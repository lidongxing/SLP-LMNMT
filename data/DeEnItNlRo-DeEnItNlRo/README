For any non zero-shot translation pair x-y, the in-domain parallel
training data is provided through the following files:

train.tags.x-y.x
train.tags.x-y.y

They include transcripts and manual translations of the talks
available at the TED website for each pair x-y on April 26th,
2017. The talks included in the development (and forthcoming
evaluation) sets have been removed.

The transcripts are given as pure text (UTF8 encoding), one or more
sentences per line, and are aligned (at language pair level, not
across pairs).

For tuning/development purposes, the following files are
released:

IWSLT17.TED.dev2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT17.TED.dev2010.x-y.y.xml
IWSLT17.TED.tst2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT17.TED.tst2010.x-y.y.xml

Below further information about released files is provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The files:

train.tags.x-y.x
train.tags.x-y.y

include the talks allowed to be used for training, and some metadata;
in particular, for each talk meta information is provided in between
the following tags:

<url> ... </url>
<keywords> ... </keywords>
<speaker> ... </speaker>
<talkid> ... </talkid>
<title> ... </title>
<description> ... </description>
<reviewer> ... </reviewer>
<translator> ... </translator>

The transcripts/translations are in lines not starting with the "<"
character.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The IWSLT17.TED*.xml files contain transcripts and manual translations
of the talks that can be used for tuning/development purposes in
multilingual task of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign.

The released files are in xml format. Each talk defines a single
document, for which the following tags are generally provided:

<url>: the url of the page with the text
<description>: a brief description of the talk
<keywords>: keywords of the talk
<talkid>: a numeric identfier of the talk
<title>: the title of the talk

UTF8 encoded text is segmented in sentences. Segments, given in
between tags <seg id="N"> and </seg> (N=1,2,...), can include more
than a single sentence. Segments of files *.x-y.x.xml and *.x-y.y.xml
are aligned.
