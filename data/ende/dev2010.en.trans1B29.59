last year , i showed these two slides to tell that the arctic iceskappe , which had been the size of the lower 48 states for annahernd , to have 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t print strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic eiskappe is the heart of our global climate system .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and it &apos;s shrinking in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a period of time in the last 25 years .
the permanent is tagged with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue , and this is the annual ice in winter , and it shrink in summer .
so what &apos;s called thumbs , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming causes the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there are great amount of carbon in which when he stopped diving from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , this amount could double it if we translate that critical point .
already today , in some areas , seen in alaska methane in alaska .
professor katey walter of university in alaska is with another work group to another areas of lake last winter .
video : wow ! al gore : you gore : you &apos;re okay. the question is how are we going to look at us .
and one reason is this tremendous warm stopping greenland from the north .
this is a annual divergence .
but the volume are essential than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southern greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes through countries , it goes up to the sea .
these rivers take rapide .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice in the planet .
last month , researchers learn that the entire continent has a negative ice cream .
and the westantarktis , which is over a few underwater islands , is particularly in the melting .
this is 20 feet of seaohe , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third ice cream , you see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
in the anden , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the amount of water have gone .
but if you &apos;re driving , most of the drinking water will go away .
in california , a 40 percent decrease of the snail of sierra .
this is the memory of memory .
and the predictions , as you read them are serious .
and this illumination all over the world leads to a dramatic increase to fire .
and the catastrophic everywhere in the world have actually taken out of a really exploded and never seen out of the resources .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unhappy evolution .
if you look at this in the historic context , you can see what it matters .
over the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced every 24 hours--25 million tons every day in the ocean .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent and beiderseits of the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a drastic feedback of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , by deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the same biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two largest pollution together with china .
and the proposal was to build many other coal factorys .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were made in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
despite that , there &apos;s a political shift in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industry have spent a quarter of a quarter of last kale years to get clean coal , which is already a contradiction .
this picture reminds me of something .
to walk around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of coallamm .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our whole country of the second largest waste of america .
this happened by christmass .
one of the commercials of coal industry around christmas was this .
frosty of carbon is a pleasure , happy boom .
it gives him in skin and fill in america , and it helps our economy .
frosty , the carbonman will become cleaner every day .
he &apos;s paid and loving , and workers remain in lohn and bread .
al gore : this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful worker is the leader of massy coal .
video : don blankenship : let me say one clearly. al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
al gore : so the alliance of climate protects two campaigns into life .
this is one , part of her .
video : actor : coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on top of the top of the amount of money to provide an advertiser on the way , to get the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean--and we also smell good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that back .
video : actor : clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of these modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable coal technology that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is today , clean coal technology .
al gore : finally , the positive alternatives with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
narrator : american : america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that each of these connects is our dependency of carbon @-@ based forces like dirt coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to liberate us from this mistake .
in fact , american america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get back to work , to make us safer and help us stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
supply america &apos;s new. find more .
al gore : this is the last one .
narrator : narrator : it &apos;s about a neural of america .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence of old , dirty forces that we &apos;re going to cut our world .
man : the future is here. wind , sun and a new energy system .
man number two : new investments to create well paid jobs .
narrator : supply america. it &apos;s time to accept reality .
&quot; al gore : there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot;
&quot; if you want to come far , go together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave a leader to the lhc .
and i promised back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s like this. and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that &apos;s ever done--27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that exists less than a milliardstel second after the universe--and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within one second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine below gene .
we take pictures of these mini @-@ big bangs in detectors .
i work on that. he &apos;s called atlas detector--44 meters in the broad , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in construction so you can see the scale .
on september 9 / 11 , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it causes immense juble in control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiationpartikels that goes back the whole road around the lhc , then with a part of the lhc collar collar to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the largest juble , or this , as somebody went to the google side and came up with this .
it means we &apos;re generating a cultural impact on the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had to do with these wires here--these golden wire here .
these wired 13 @-@ thousand ampere when the machine goes up to high @-@ performance .
&quot; now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; &quot; no , no you don &apos; t. these are little wires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them very far , you become a superconductor .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the stars between the stars , those wires can make tension .
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was an enormous amount of memory .
so by heating the wires and 13 @-@ thousand ampere suddenly got electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is impressed when you imagine that the magnets are like 20 tons , and it &apos;s about 30 centimeters .
so we ran about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we were able to redesign them , fix them .
they &apos;re all back to your way again .
by the end of march , the lhc is going to be a functionful .
we &apos;re going to turn it down , and we &apos;re expecting first data in june or juli , and we &apos;re going to continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , such an unprecedented kind of accidents again , the debate about the value of science and engineering , and it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re going beyond our borders , is the value of things like the lhc .
&quot; i &apos;m going to leave my restrained words of a english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i guess when he gave the useless experiments of his teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday , which said , &quot; &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the
thank you .
and i want to ask you to ask you to think about the time of your childhood when they played bauklotcence .
while they realized how to examine the hands and enrich the cotze and moves , they actually learned to solve and solve problems through understanding and changing spatial contexts .
the space thinking is tightly connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects--together with my colleague of jeevan kalanithi and colleagues , i started wondering : what if we were using computers , the approach of a mouse zeiger that moves like a digital fingertip on a surface of work . . . .
and you could anordze how we want it ?
so this question was so exciting that we developed research and siftables .
in short , an siftable is a interactive computer in the size of a kekses .
you can be moving with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can summarize your movements , and you have a screen and a functioning .
much more importantly , are physically physically why you can only move it through the slime of hands and access to it .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation digital data .
and if these aids become more physical and develop a awareness for their movements , recognize each other , and the lack of our contractes with them , we can start with the exploration of new and connective interaction .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
that siftable is configuring for the video , and if i go to a direction , the video is going forward ; if i go to the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them next to each other , you &apos;re going to get interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by users , you &apos;re looking at it and you can become something nervous .
and they also feel their movements and no .
a interesting consequence of interactions that we began to see was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color so much as you do with fluids .
in this case , we &apos;ve been configuring three siftables as coloropfe , and i can use it to grind color in the middle where they &apos;re then mixed .
if we exaggerate it , we can climb a little bit back .
there &apos;s also some nice possibilities in education like languages , math or logical games , where we &apos;re giving people the ability of fast , and we want to see the results immediately .
here &apos;s me . . . this is a fibonacci consequence i &apos;ve been working with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words , which is sort of mixture of scrabble and bow .
basically , you get any round on every siftable random letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re going to check those over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you &apos;ve got a new letter of letters and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up with a media lab , and i could move it out and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
and one of the interesting circumstances in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
&quot; all you have to say is &quot; &quot; bildet words &quot; &quot; and you know exactly what to do . &quot;
here are some people testing it .
this is our youngest beta test there on the bottom right there .
it turned out that he wanted to stack the siftables .
so for him , they were just bauklotze .
this is an interactive trick film application .
we wanted to develop a learning learning .
this is rock .
he can bring new characters into the scene by taking the siftable from the table , showing this figure .
here he &apos;s going to go up the sun .
now he &apos;s a tractor in the scene .
good work ! yeah !
by shakeing the siftables , and she can put them next to each other . . .
. . . he &apos;s invent his own story .
it &apos;s a story with openness , and it can decide how they &apos;re developing .
the last example i have time to show it is a music sequencer for live record that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the siftables as a tone , like leadership , bass and headlines .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can put this sound into the sequence that you can anord in any pattern .
and you put them in by just giving a ton @-@ siftable to a sequence of siftable .
there are effects that you can change live like hall and filter .
you connect it with a particular tone , and then you pick it up .
and then more transitioned effects like pace and noisy that you use on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting where we &apos;re using the leadership in two sequences of siftable , and we &apos;re putting it into a series of anord , and they &apos;re expanding and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass now .
now i &apos;m going to do something more headlines .
and now i spend the filter with the stroke so i can control the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by getting the tempo into one way or another .
and now i &apos;m still verbing the filter with the bass ; something more expresses .
i can make the sequence as they go .
so i don &apos;t need to plan them in the front of it , but i can improvise them ; they can consume or sales .
and finally , i can break out the whole sequence by taking the loud siftable left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human computers that fit better to how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea i want to share with you on the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold to this new generation of value to interact with digital media , bringing information into our world that is in our demands .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m excited about all of you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
but recently , a little bit more weird in my life and my career that made me rethink my relationship to this work .
&quot; this weird event was that i recently wrote a book recently--a biografie called &quot; &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; &quot; which , unlike all my previous books out of any reason , and became a big mega @-@ event , international bestseller thing . &quot;
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m the bottom line .
seriously--the bottom line !
&quot; for example , they come up with me and they say , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to get this success ? &quot;
&quot; do you have no fear that you continue to describe your whole life and never create a book that interested in the world ? never again ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay , that &apos;s really courageful .
however , it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that 20 years ago , when i first told the teenager for the first time that i wanted to be a writer that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of fearful response .
&quot; people said , &quot; &quot; do you &apos;re not afraid to succeed ? &quot;
do you &apos;re not afraid you &apos;re going to kill the humility of a treaty ?
&quot; you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;re going to see your life for your life , and you &apos;re never going to get something out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a eradication of dreams--your mouth filled with the bitter asche of failure ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you know .
&quot; the answer--the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m afraid a lot more things that nobody would be dead , like algae--and other feared things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about that for a minute , and i &apos;ve been thinking , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that somebody should expect that he &apos;s afraid to do the work he felt ?
and what &apos;s happening to the creative perception that they &apos;re making us insecure about the other mind--in a way how other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years than chemist , where he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your chemist blockade , john--how are you doing this ?
it just wasn &apos;t coming , you know ?
but to be fair--the group of chemists have not received the reputation of alcohol manic manic people .
we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writer , but the creative of all genres , seem to have this reputation to be mentally unstable .
all you have to do is look at the bitter death of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who died and often died from their hands .
and even those who don &apos;t actually start to start suicidal had been considered by their talents .
&quot; norman mailer recently said to his death in his last interview , &quot; &quot; each of my books killed me a little further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extraordinary statement you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even even know if we hear someone like this because we know this kind of statement since we &apos;ve been doing so long , and somehow we have the constitution so verification and collectively accept that creativity and suffering , of course , and that art--at the end--always
the question i want to ask today is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel that ?
because with just one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel at all .
i find them off .
and i find them dangerous. and i don &apos;t want to look at what it &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative experience .
and i don &apos;t know that it &apos;s definitely for me--in my situation--very dangerous to start to download this dark path of the guinea--especially in the circumstances that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means--look , i &apos;m pretty young. i &apos;m about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 worker year in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write about now from the world as the work that came after my last book , right ?
i &apos;m just saying it straightforward , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here--it &apos;s probably likely that my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring somebody to start to drink 9 a. m. in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would keep doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflection , i &apos;m going to be able to write that i &apos;m going to continue to write , i &apos;m going to have to design some kind of psychological construction .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural movement about how the response will be written .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for doing that , i &apos;ve also been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they had better or reasonable ideas about how to help creativity with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this search led me to the old greece , and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will close again .
but in the ancient greece and the rome didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of god servant that comes from a distant , unknown source to people--from unerklar , unknown reasons .
&quot; the greeks called these god servant spirits of creativity &quot; &quot; damonen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from sokrates , he believed that he had a damon who was moving wisdom from distant distant .
&quot; the romer had the same idea , called this kind of physical creative mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s great. the romer didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , who believed that it was recently living in the walls of an art &apos;s design--about such as dobby , the house--the rauskame and the artists in the work was made invisible and the result of work .
this is brilliant--there it is , there &apos;s the distance i talked about--the psychological construction that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked so much ?
the artist of aging was protected before certain things , like , for example , too much narcississm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you would have enjoy this bodyless that helped you .
when your work was rivers--not your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then renaissance came along and changed everything , and we had this big idea , and that big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe--about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no space more for mystical creatures who assume the boundary of
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call this genius , or those artists--instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
i think you know ? i think he thinks he thinks he &apos;s thinking , he &apos;s like , or she &apos;s like the size , like the wake and the essence and the source of all god , creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a small bit too much responsibility to make a woman ,
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
that contains it and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these unexpected expectations of success .
i think that this success pressure has dropped our artist over the last 500 years .
&quot; and , if that &apos;s true , &quot; &quot; and i think it &apos;s true--is the question . &quot;
can we change it ?
maybe to an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just make the thoughts from 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 @-@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who were really compelling scientific doubt about the idea of--basically--fees , people are following and using fees on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to design is why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it &apos;s as much sense as everything else i heard about when it was about explaining the absolute crazy way of explaining the creative process .
one process that--like everybody knows who has ever been trying to do something--in other words , everyone here--doesn &apos;t always get reasonable .
in fact , he can feel paranormal sometimes .
i recently recently had such encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , which is now about 90 , but her whole life was dense , and she told me she was growing up in the village virginia outside on the fields , and she said she would feel and hear them like a poem about the landscape
she said it would be like a thunder of air .
the country on them would be hanging out .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under your feet .
&quot; she knew that she could only do one moment , and that was--in your words , &quot; &quot; run like the hell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they ran like the hell to the house as they were followed by this poem , and it was unique that it had to get fast enough to get a piece of paper and a pen , so she could catch it through it through it , and they could go through the leaf .
&quot; in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough. she ran and rane and rane , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she wouldn &apos;t roll the poem through them , and she missed it. she said , &quot; &quot; as she said , &quot; &quot; after another poet . &quot; &quot;
and then there were these moments--i &apos;m never going to forget--she said that there were eyes in which they almost missed it .
so , she &apos;s running to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem through it , and she &apos;s going through a pen as it goes through it , and then--she said--it was as if she was with her other hand , and it would get it .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she moved back to her body , and took it back to the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came in and intimate on the paper--but backwards from the last word for the first one .
&quot; when i heard that , i thought , &quot; &quot; this is incredibly--that &apos;s exactly what my creative process goes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s not like my creative process--i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a pocket. to work every day , i &apos;ve got to stand up at the same time and sweat , and i &apos;m really unpleasant and really unpleasant .
but even in my pockets , sometimes i &apos;ve encountered this thing .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
even i had work or ideas that came out of a source that i can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we keep losing it without losing our minds , but in the contrary , we even think of intellectual health ?
for me , the best example of how to create this is the musicians tom waits , and i &apos;ve been interviewing him for a magazine .
we talked about this issue. and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodied of the modern art artist , who tried to master these uncontrolleled creative impulses who were living in a living with them .
but then he got older and quiet. he told me that one day he went to a rapidstraße in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was with higher speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which , as it &apos;s often with inspiration , is difficult for him , and he wants them. it &apos;s scared , but he can &apos;t stop it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he has no cheeserekorder .
&quot; so he starts putting up these old encounters in him , like &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be followed by that song . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of asking panic , he just stopped .
he ended up working all the way , and he did something completely new .
&quot; he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; &quot; sorry , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving car ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; i look like this as if i could just describe a song ? &quot;
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment when i can take care of you .
if not , anybody else else else today .
&quot; go and go , &quot; &quot; cohen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his whole work process has changed after that .
not the work itself. it &apos;s often been as dark as eh and je .
but the process and the hard movement that rejected him was when he took out the genius , where he did nothing as trouble , and he left him back where he came back , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a verimind thing .
there could be a weird , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , extraordinarily thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit about how i worked , and it &apos;s saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat , pray pray , love , and i fell in one of those two manufacturings that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work. you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just hire the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i listened to my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my comment in a blank corner of space .
&quot; i talked loud , &quot; &quot; listen , you know , you and i both know when this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot;
because you see i invest everything i have , i don &apos;t have anymore .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to pick up here , and you &apos;ve got to stop your percentage .
okay. but if you don &apos;t do that . . . you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
&quot; and i want to give you a protocol that i was here today for my part of the jobs today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because . . . . at the end of the end , it &apos;s like follows--centuries ago , in the desert of north africa , people have given moon dancers with holy dancing and music that were deposited for hours--to the morning .
these fixed were always great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rarely , happened something special , and one of the inventions actually became more common .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen in your life already have such a representation .
it was as if the time was still still and the dancers go through a kind of crazy , and he did nothing else when he ever did it before--1 , 000 nights before. but it was all connected together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t work longer anymore .
he was smiling by inside and down , and all of that stuck through a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was , they called it at his name .
&quot; they put hands together and began singing , &quot; &quot; allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic footnote : when the mohren southspanien brought them to this thing. the language changed over the centuries of &quot; &quot; allah , allah , allah--ole ole , ole , ole--that you still hear about stierco and flamenco .
&quot; if there &apos;s something impossible in spain , something magical has done : &quot; &quot; allah , ole , ole , allah , great , bravo--inevitably , there &apos;s an escape view on god . &quot;
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer itself wake up and recognize that it &apos;s 11 clock in a tuesday--and he doesn &apos;t wear a function of god .
he &apos;s only an older mortal star with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to get to that high .
and maybe he &apos;s never going to call god &apos;s name again if he &apos;s about it , but what should he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correct correction of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be as full of pein if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your body came from you .
if you may only believe that you &apos;re a sorry--from an unpredictable source for a chicken of your life that will go to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety in the past months while i was working on the book soon soon--as the most dangerous , scary , strong expectancy of mine .
what i &apos;ve got to tell myself is , when i &apos;m going to crazy about it , is no fear .
don &apos;t distilled. just do your job .
be there for your contribution , whatever he likes .
if your job is dancing , dance .
&quot; if the stupid god geniuses that you &apos;re asked to show you , you know , show a bunch of wound through your efforts , &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if not , they dance , they dance .
&quot; and &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; for all of you . &quot;
i believe it , and i feel that we should teach that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; for you all , just for you to have the naked human love and the property to be there . &quot;
thank you .
thank you .
june cohen : ole !
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask ourselves important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simplify different approaches to simplify it to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years. when we sequenced the human genome , the shift of the analog world of biology to the digital world of computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our. trust me , that &apos;s simpel. but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome is actually synthesizing what allows us to cook the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it enable chemistry to create these really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical materials .
our steps at the digitalization of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but yet , our last point is now on an exponential curve .
we started this 15 years ago .
it actually took several years with a bioethic review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out dna synthesizing is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that have small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece that &apos;s going to happen more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we created little pieces , made a mistake feed , and we had a dna molecule from about 5 , 000 letters .
the spannende phase came when we took this piece of chemist and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then were released by cells and came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were exactly trying to get this model .
they laughed more than you do here , so we think this is a situation in software actually can build the hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further further. we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580 , 000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we &apos;d build it in kasp from the size of the virus , where we could vary the size of the tapes to understand what
design is the key , and when you start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really mistakeful .
when we first sequenced the genome of 1995 , the mistake rate was a 10 , 000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been able to go up .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and have to move over with other 50 letters to build smaller sub @-@ units so that they can fit together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water signs .
think about it : we have a four @-@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of these letters--these letters envy about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single punch for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , minds .
at first , we only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we &apos;ve constructed the play so that we could just break them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that fix those and again .
and we &apos;ve started making pieces of pieces , starting with pieces that have five @-@ to @-@ seven thousand letters , they &apos;ve been able to make it 24 , 000 letters to make it back together , to 72 , 000 .
in every step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the intersection so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the car .
so , this looks like a basketball machine .
if we get to this really big piece of pieces--with over 100 , 000 base pairs--these aren &apos;t going to grow in e. colis , it &apos;s all kinds of possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to build other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the homologist recombination that the biology uses to fix dna that can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it. there &apos;s an organism called yournococcus radiodurans over three million bike radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been so profound again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally excited , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space can exist and move , looking for aquatian conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
here &apos;s a tremendous of the molecule we &apos;ve made by using these processes--in fact , we &apos;ve only used hot mechanisms with the right design of the piece we &apos;ve introduced it. yes , these are then automatic together .
this is not an electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are shots about six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve just finished recently recently .
these are over 580 , 000 letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the biggest molecule with defined structure ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to express it with a writer of 10 and no treaty , it &apos;s got to deal with the 142 pages just to express these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus. it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpler if you &apos;re in eukar labs like we &apos;re doing it : you just take out the nucleus and you have another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the cloning .
in archaebak bacteria , the chromosome integrated into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve just shown that you can take a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to the other and activate them .
we &apos;re put the chromosome of a microbial track , and we &apos;re told these two are distant away from people and mice , and we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome , and we &apos;re decompose it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing than
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get a little bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of somewhere , each time thousands of characteristics in just one second .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time , has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restriction of restriction that are actually digitized dna .
the chromosomeom that was in the cell hasn &apos;t gotten ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was expressed in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it uses blue because of the genes we had .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and completely based in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes--when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transfered .
it may sound like genome alchimia , but we can , by shifting the software dna , things are pretty dramatically dramatic .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genesis--that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of cambriaing explosion where there might be massive new kinds of education based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in what we need .
we &apos;re growing up by six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my relationship : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet exists for every year in 1946 , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
we need five billion tons of coal , 30 @-@ plus billion fasser oil. these are hundreds of millions of barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that landed in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and you can see the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re in the first line here to the limits of biological reality , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking about .
we have technology today because of these rapid synthesis , to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot to build millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to make oktan or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just selective selection. we can select lifespan production , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a shot of really design software that we &apos;re working with , in fact , and you know , new species on the computer design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like. we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we now focus on fuels of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of the second and third generations that are relatively soon coming out , the much higher sugar skills , like oktan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way we think it &apos;s a huge impact with the cost of food or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as a accessibleterial , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first fuel of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and carbon is a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways of doing it .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one--a mile deep , in almost cooked wateratures .
it changes co2 in methane under the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought to production , convert co2 into fuel to join this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the most fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really--moderate goals like the use of the entire petrochemical industry. exactly. if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? to become a main source of energy .
but just as we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re working on the same approach for the vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;ve always got a year back and have a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that that can be changed by making recombinatorial vaccines in the front .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerating the evolutionary tree with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eucards .
we are light years away from improving people , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that. thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a super @-@ year ago. this is seadragon .
and it &apos;s an environment where you can either either be locally or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we &apos;re seeing many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can take nutrition and continue to recommend , recommend , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collection are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one is a scan of congress , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 megapixels .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen .
every moment. it has a very flexible architecture too .
this is a whole book , an example of non @-@ imagery .
this is bleak house of thick. every day , it &apos;s a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the texts and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e @-@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case. this is a task of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper of a magazine or a newspaper , which is sort of a medium with several orders of magnitude .
we also did something about the corner of this particular task of the guardian .
we designed a false advertisement with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal advertiser , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specialized .
and this is really putting up these ideas , to create these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean pop @-@ ups and other nonsense means more--that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the u. s .
over the top of the planet , on the earth &apos;s soil of nasa .
now let &apos;s take something else .
this is actually live on the internet. you can check it .
this is a project called photosynth that really connects two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other one is a very good research about computervision , which is from noah snavely , a university of university of washington , among the consultation of steve page at uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research. a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet. it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we create this kind of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the previous resolution .
but the spacecraft of the images here is actually meaning .
the computer @-@ vision algorithms have shown these images together with the real space where these revenues that were all made in the grassi lakes in the kanadischen rockies , and you can see elements of stabilized dias or panoramic imageverarbeitung , and these things would all be in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are things that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data data flows from noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of photosynth where we &apos;ve been working on the summer to show you what i think is really the pointe behind this technology , photosynth technology , and this is not necessarily
we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstructed of the cathedral notre dame , which is only in the computer .
with images of flickr , they just put notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to have images of men in t @-@ shirts and on the university room and so on .
every one of these orange practices represent a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so these are all flickr images , and they all stand in space in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work with microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the receiver here .
i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is from the cell phone camera to professional slrs , a pretty big number of them that all of us in this environment would come together .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strangers , many of them are violating faces and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photography--here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment. it &apos;s now collected data from all of us .
from all collective memory of what , visual the earth looks like--and everything &apos;s connected to each other .
all these photos are connected , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the whole world .
consider this as the progress of work of stephen lawlers to virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going through complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s growing , and it &apos;s going to use the use of using the use of use .
your own photos will be caught with metadata that has a different person .
if somebody &apos;s done the courage , and i think , who you &apos;re all--and then my photograph of the notre dame cathedral suddenly is suddenly filled with all these data , and i can use it as ancestor to dive in this space , in these metaverse , using photos of other
and of course , byproduct , all of these are the immens @-@ rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that would not only get through overwhelmed or satellites and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
chris anderson : i understand you right ? your software enables that to a particular time , within the next few years , all pictures that are used by somebody in the world are used in principle ?
baa : yeah. she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discovering , and if you want to build it hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the full of semantic information that have lots of these images .
how if you take a websuon for images where you spend sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what that is .
but how about the image you &apos;re linked to all your images ?
and then the environment of semantic cross , and the fill of it that makes it really , really .
enormous. it &apos;s a classic networks .
ca : blaise , that &apos;s really incredible. happy. baa : thank you very much .
you know , one of the great impacts in the journey , and one of the joy of ethnic research is to live together with people who still remember the old days , and the past still feel in the wind , they touched on the rains of the rain , they tasted into the bitter leaves of the
just knowing that jaguar shamans are still beyond the milky way or the mythology of myths of the oldest inuit , or that in the himalayas , the buddhists still follow the breath of the dharma , means that the engagement of the anthropology means that the
as a result of a group of specific possibilities of adaptable ourselves , when things were successful , many generations .
and of course , we all share the same adaptability .
we &apos;re all born. we bring children to the world .
we go through initiation reactors .
we &apos;ve got to put up with the computational separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in borneo , or the voodoo @-@ akolythen in haiti , or the warrior in the kaisut desert of nordkenia , the curanderos in the sahara , or a karawanserei in the middle of
everest , the god &apos;s grandmother .
all of these people teach us that there are other existence , other thinking , other ways to orient on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , you can only fill one with hope .
together , the number one cultures in the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that &apos;s about to deal with the earth , and for the well of the earth , the organic lifestyle you know , you know , as a biological lifestyle you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural lifestyle as a ethnic surface , ethnosphere , as the total consumption of all thoughts and dreams , myths of ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been released from the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we are capable of astonishing knowledge species .
and just like biosphere has been done strong , this happened with the ethnic surface--only with bigger speed .
no biologists would say , for example , that 50 percent or more species are short before the extinction , because it &apos;s simply not right , and yet , this--the apocalyptic sexual scenario on the area of biological diversity--is hardly hardly what is known as optimistic scenario
and the key indicator for that is the extinction of languages .
when every one of them was born in this room , on earth &apos;s girls were talked about .
now , a language is not just the totalness of the vocabulary or a series of grammar .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that finds the soul of a particular culture access to the material world .
every language is like a old understanding forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half of them is not growing into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught little kids anymore , which means that if nothing is taken , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be lonely than to be swiss , to be one of the last of your people talking about your language , to have no way to keep the wisdom of ancestors , or to expect children ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually resemble somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , a older person dies , taking the last silver of an old language with a grave .
&quot; and i know some of you say , &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it better like this ? &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we &apos;d all talk about a language ? &quot; &quot; and i say , &quot; &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language yoruba. let them be
&quot; let &apos;s be cogi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then they suddenly recognize how it would be if they couldn &apos;t talk about their own language .
so today i want to take you to a journey through the race , a short journey through the race to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
&quot; now there are some of us who forgotten forget that if i say , &quot; &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; &quot; really different possibilities of being . &quot;
for example , for example , this kid of barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of anakology , believe that they made the milk &apos;s influence from the east , in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people that &apos;s not cognitive between the color blue and green , because the sky coats the forest , the people depend on .
they &apos;ve got a strange language , and a heirent line called the linguistic exmendously : you have to marry somebody who speaks another language .
all of these worms in the mythological past , and the weird thing about these big houses where six or seven languages are talked about because of the mix , you never hear someone who &apos;s learning language .
you just listen to , and then start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that would first contact in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to take up and made a difficult mistake .
they &apos;re waiting for glacial photos of themselves from the air , which we &apos;d be comfortable as a friendly gesture , and forget that these people from the rainforest in your lifetime never saw something two dimensions .
they were listening to these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face , or the figure , they didn &apos;t see anything , and they found that these business cards of the devil and killed five missionaries with the spear .
but the waorani didn &apos;t kill just outside with the spear .
they &apos;re running each other .
54 percent of death accidents happened through the currency .
we followed the geneticlogy eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we looked at the people with the print , they gave them something about it , they gave them that one of the people got so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear ,
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps and see what animal heard of that .
in the early &apos; 80iger years , i got a really amazing job when my professor in harvard asked me if i was interested in haiti and the secret societies that were the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies safe .
to give this sensation , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of the vodoun and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in fact , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to tell you about telling the great world record , what would you say ?
christians , islam , buddhism , judaism or whatever .
a continent is always left , because the guess was that in black africa , there was no religious faith , and of course , there was one and voodoo is just thinking about this very profound religious thoughts during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this living relationship between living and the dead .
the living prayers the spirit .
the ghosts can be picked up from under the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to explore the soul of living , so that the akolyth is going to be for a brief moment to god .
&quot; so the voodooiss like to say , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to go into the church and talk about god . &quot;
&quot; we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from the mind. how can you make damage ?
now , look at this amazing demonstration : voodoo--akolythen in a trance frame , the happiest coal without interconnected , an amazing way of influence the body so that this is what it looks like when it &apos;s going to get into a state of extreme ar
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met were the kogi from sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia , the most extraordinary .
according to the old tyrann civilization , the caribbean coastal coast of colombia , and in the result , this people moved back into an isolated volcanoful massive mass that goes over the caribbean coast .
in a blood flow continent , these people were the only ones that have never been put from the spanish .
until today &apos;s day , you &apos;re going to have government from a ritual priest , but the education of the priest is very extraordinary .
the young man in the age of three and four years are separated from their families , and in a shadowy world of the photograph , in stoners for 18 years , at the feet of the glaciers for 18 years , two years of time , for example , nine years , are chosen to think about
and throughout that time , they &apos;re introduced cultures in the values of their society , and values that keep the claim that their prayers and only her prayers , the cosmic--or we could say the ecological--balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken back to one day , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you can see a sunrise , and in this crystalery moment of consciousness of the first light of the first light , when the sun begins to
&quot; and says , &quot; &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really like me telling you . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so wonderful. you have to protect it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves the older brother , and they say we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of domestic and landscapes , we &apos;re going to get either rousseau and the old smell of the noble wild wild , which is in his simplistic idea or thoreau and say , these people are connected to nature than we are .
so , domestics are not sentimental , but they &apos;re not seen by nostalgia .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malaria @-@ performance sump of tibet or the cold winds of tibet , but they &apos;ve yet yet , through time and ritual , they &apos;ve got a mysterious takebus of the earth who is not based on the idea of being able to be aware of their
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the anden that believe in believe that the mountain is an apu mind , who &apos;s going to be or their fate will be a whole different person , and have another relationship to that resource or that place , as a little kid from montana that believe that a mountain is a
whether it &apos;s an insurgency of a mind or a bunch of earth , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia and believed that these forests are there to be gerogling .
that made me another human than my friends under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests of the up @-@ down hukuk and the prayers and the canadian ghosts are thrilled to the north of the world , geister that they &apos;ve been involved in their hamatsa initiation
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different reality , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries here .
it &apos;s a photo that i took up last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoactive preparat from the repertoire of the shaman .
what ayahuasca does so fascinating is not just the pharmaceutical potential of this preparats , but whose processing , it &apos;s really made of two different sources. on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of beta cards , harmin , harmin ,
with the name of psychotria viridis .
these plant contains some very strong tryptamine that the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ five and methoxydimethyltryptamin are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen yanomami , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you make from different species , methoxydimethyltryptamin .
that powder is about how to be raised from a gun , transforming barocken painting and the landing on an ocean of electricity , and it &apos;s not going to make sense of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor richard evan shultes , the guy who has psychedelic area with the developments of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30iger years , and i realized that you couldn &apos;t get this tryptamine as a hallucination , because the moment
because of course , in the human gut , you &apos;re going to be able to get an augmented enzyme with monoamin oxidase .
they can only be brought in with some other chemicals oral , which are the maocils .
now the fascinating thing is that the beta card that are in the liane are inhibitor mao--inhibitores of exactly the kind that is necessary to potential the tryptamine. so you ask yourself .
how can these people come from a flora of 80 , 000 species of adstringing plants these two morphological plants , which , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and mistake , which turns out to be meaningless .
&quot; but you ask the indians to say , &quot; &quot; the plants are talking to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this stem , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize in the forest that seem to seem as a kind of a way .
&quot; and then you ask them how they use their taxonomie and they say , &quot; &quot; i thought you &apos;d understand something about plants . &quot;
&quot; i mean , do you know anything ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , it turns out that every one of the 17 varieties at fullmond and sing you in a different sound .
now , that doesn &apos;t make a ph. d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than stamina. now , the problem--the problem is that even those of us who have those who have sympathy for the difficulty of the population , but they look at orginie
so , the fact is that in 300 years , in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember its wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were to get , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity in the earth are either active or acceptively accepted. so the problem is
all cultures have involved in the dance with new choices .
and the problem is not the technology of themselves .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t hear less on sioux than they were bogen and arrows , when americans stopped americans , when they were horse and horses .
not change and technology threatens the integrity of ethnicphere. it &apos;s power. it &apos;s the ugly face of the heart .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;re discovering that these cultures aren &apos;t underestimated , these are dynamic living peoples , their existence through erkennbar forces that will go beyond their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s about the unfolding logging in the home country , a nomads population
and now , prostitution at the river page , and prostitution was humiliated , from where you can see that even the river is going to take away with the slamm , which seems almost half of borneo into the south machines , from where the japanese helicopters at the horizon are willing to
where it &apos;s disease rays that were trained during the gold rush .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m much more researching , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyic spreads of people will be convicted , but the ethnozid , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not just convicted , but in many ways , as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand tibet &apos;s suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the bottom level .
i was traveling with a young colleague of chengdu in westchina overland through southost tibet to lhasa , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear . 1.2 million people who were transformed in school and asche . 1.2 million
the father of this young man was identified as a tagging of the panchen lama .
what that meant is that he was killed immediately during the chinese invasion .
his uncle flew with her sacredness into the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was introduced as punishment for--to be wealthy for crime .
he was slept at the age of two years to hide under your rocktic because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that this brave was beginning was put into an education .
and one day she looked up on a armband maos , and for that transition , she had to be in a heavy work camp for seven years .
the suffering tibet &apos;s suffering can be infinite , but the parachute mind is a little bit uncomfortable .
and at the end , we really stand in a choice. do we want to live in a monopoly world of monotoniis or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist before she died , that while we &apos;re moving towards a thorough , designing worldview , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole range of human imagination on a senior way , but that we &apos;ve been growing up from a dream
and it &apos;s humiliated to think that our species might have existed for 600 , 000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at this moment , the cult of the seed , the poetry of the shamans replaced by the prosa of the priest department and herearchies , specialization and oversimplishment--only 10 , 000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it &apos;s hardly 300 years old .
now , this surface story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are facing in the next millennia .
if we ask these unpaid world reserves after the importance of humanity , they answer 10 , 000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rebuild the ability to be what we are : people with full awareness that are the importance that all the people and gardens have to be able to be able to get a space , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a picture i took up at the north end of the tree when i went to the narwhal hunt , and this man , olaya , i told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government hasn &apos;t gone very well with the inuit , and during the 50iger years , they were forced to pull in them into them .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family who feared his life took him all weapons and all the tools .
now , you have to know that inuit , there &apos;s no fear of the cold , and they used to use it to their advantage .
the slice of their slices were made originally made from fish that was introduced in karibu skin .
the grandfather of the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear before the arctic night or the best storm .
he &apos;s swallowed out to the outside , and he got down his pants out of seafell , and he &apos;s going to shrink up in his hand , and when the feces started to frightze it , he would form them into the form of a knife .
he sprayed memory on the page of the fakalien knife , and when it was completely frozen , it was a dog .
he &apos;s getting the dog and improvising a difference , took the skeleton of the dog and improvise a slight , spane a different dog , and it turned out to be the icechol with the fakalien knife on the continent .
so you can &apos;t do anything out of it , and this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all of the people in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 the complete control over a area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called the nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area. you control all the mineral .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can search and reach with their residents .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are headed to these distant goals of the earth is that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that come back in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think that politicians never reach anything .
we believe that polemik--we believe that polemik isn &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world. our website contains 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our television state .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of travel into the ethnic world where we take our audience to places such cultural miracles that they &apos;re seen by that , and hopefully , you &apos;re going to assume one after the other of the central revelations of the anthropology : that this world has
the wisdom of all people can contribute to our common well @-@ being .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that you &apos;ve heard with other ceilings that you &apos;ve already heard , and trying to create connections if you &apos;re not going to notice .
&quot; i want to start with what i call &quot; &quot; official dogma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official faith of all western industries .
the official dogma is that when our goal is maximizing the well @-@ being of our citizens , it &apos;s all about maximizing freedom of the individual freedom .
and the reason for that is that freedom is about and for the good , valuable , meaningful and essential for humanity .
if people have freedoms , then each of us are self @-@ esteem to do things that maximize our common and nobody has to decide for us .
maximize the way liberty is to maximize choices .
the more choices have people , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think so deep in us , that it wouldn &apos;t get any sense to question it .
and it &apos;s also profound in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you a couple of examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket. no bigger .
just a little bit too saladdressing .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t talk about 10 different native olive oil and 12 balsamico @-@ essigs , which you could buy to create a large number of salad remotes in the unlikely case that they don &apos;t like the 175 in the store .
so the supermarket works .
and then they go to a electronics to put together a stereo system--lonely , cd player , kassetten record , radio , promise , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo systems .
we can put together 6.5 million different stereos from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit , that &apos;s a big choice .
in other areas--the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you got every telephone service you wanted to , as long as he came from ma bell .
you mimic the phone and you didn &apos;t buy it .
as a consequence , the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle--mp3 player , nose hair trimmer and creme brulee flamer .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you &apos;ll be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
it brings people to walk into business and ask that question .
you know the answer to that question ?
&quot; the answer is &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s impossible to buy a cell phone , not too much .
for others who are much more important than shopping are the same for the explosion of choices .
healthcare--in the united states , it &apos;s no longer the case that you go to the doctor , and he says what to do .
&quot; instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; we could do a. b . &quot;
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this advantage and risks. what do they want to do ?
&quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the doctor says , &quot; &quot; a has this advantage and risks and b those advantages and risks . &quot;
&quot; what do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; if you were i , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is , we call &quot; &quot; patientenautonomia . &quot; &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but it shifts the last of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something , because of the doctor , to somebody who doesn &apos;t know , and the most likely is sick , and that&apos;
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and me , what if you think you don &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they deal with us if we can &apos;t buy ?
because they expect us to call the doctor on the next morning and ask a change of prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice to show this slide .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
and we reinvent ourselves as much as we want .
d. h every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family once was the standard effect , almost everybody had one , and you got married as fast as you could .
&quot; the only true choice was &quot; &quot; who , &quot; &quot; not when , and not what they did . &quot;
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach you wonderful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i used to be .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful .
&quot; but because they &apos;re busy with other things ; they &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot;
&quot; or later ? should i have children , do i make a career ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
they &apos;re all going to ask questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions , even if you don &apos;t do their tasks and don &apos;t get good note in my course .
and you should do that. these are important to answer answers .
work--we &apos;re blessed , as carl &apos;s replied , with the technology that allows us to work every minute every day on the planet every day--to the edge of the edge .
there &apos;s a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the wlan works .
i &apos;m not saying , because i want to use .
these incredible freedom of choices to make decisions and again and again , whether we should work or not .
we can look at our kids playing the football with ourerm cell phones on one hip and our blackberry on other hips , and our laptop probably on our laptop .
&quot; and even if you &apos;re all disparate , every minute in which we look at our child at a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; &quot; should i think that call ? &quot;
&quot; the email answer ? write the letter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and even if the answer to the question is &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to practice your experience of the football of your child &apos;s soccer , very different than it was . &quot;
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived lived .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a choice of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
&quot; the answer is &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effective paradoxer way is that he &apos;s paralyzed instead of freezing .
with so many options you can choose , people are very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dragon example , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investing vanguard , the giant fond societies of about a million employees and about 2000 different jobs .
and what she found was pro 10 investmentfonds , who was the employer , took the part of two percent .
they offer 50 investment--10 percent of the employees are taking part of them as if they were just five. why ?
because it &apos;s 50 @-@ investments that are standing for choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you &apos;re supposed to vote to tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never come .
now , understand that this doesn &apos;t mean that people have to eat dogs , if they go to the back , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means that the decisions are so hard to adapt to their jobs .
by the non @-@ part , you &apos;re going to give up to 5 , 000 dollars a year from the workforce , who would have been happy to contribute their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s the case that the world looks like this. you really want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s for all eternal , right ?
they don &apos;t want to vote the wrong investment fond , or the wrong saladdressing .
so that &apos;s the effect. the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less happiness with the outcome of choice , as if we had the ability to decide between the possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is meant by the great choice of different saladdressing , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect--and what salatdressing is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different decision better than that , and what &apos;s happening is
even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there , the more simpler it &apos;s nothing to calculate that is disappointing for the choices they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitat costs .
dan gilbert did a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we measure things about what we compare .
well , if there are lots and lots of alternatives , it &apos;s easy to imagine attraktive properties of alternatives that they &apos;re out of , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example. for those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach. great day. they have it all for themselves .
&quot; what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the man thinks , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s august. everybody in my manhat &apos;s neighborhood is gone . &quot;
&quot; i could park straight before my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he verbs two weeks from the thought that he missed the ability to have a great parking lot every day .
oppertunitat cost the happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve got to do is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there &apos;s a choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are used in the oppertunitat cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes a few statements .
he &apos;s making a statement about living in now , and perhaps things slowly slowly slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing : always you choose to decide about one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things , and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do to do less .
third , the expectations of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
&quot; and there was a time in which there was only one species of a way , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve been bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they were to get them long enough , and they &apos;d often talk enough , they started to feel &quot; &quot; ok
&quot; so to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the sales said , &quot; &quot; do you want to schlanke , you want to go on , you know ? &quot;
do you want to get knobs or shattered ? stone or cleaning ?
do you want to holes with holes ?
&quot; you want to cut down far down , cut , blah blah blah blah . . . &quot; &quot; and so on . &quot;
&quot; my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way was the only way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try and try and see all these damn jeans , and put the business--and i say the truth--with the best appropriate jeans i &apos;d ever had .
i had better. all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt was that i felt bad with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what &apos;s going on for a good couple of jeans .
i had very low expectations. i didn &apos;t have concrete expectations than they were in a way .
when they came to 100 species , they digitized one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i &apos;d like what i &apos;d get to what i expect , and what i had been disappointed to what i expected .
the possibility of possibilities in people &apos;s lives are more likely to increase people &apos;s expectations about how good these possibilities are .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this .
because if you were , all you didn &apos;t know about it .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better than anything was worse , when everything was worse , was to make it possible for people who were a pleasant surprise .
nowadays in the world we live--we &apos;re comfortable , industrialized citizens , with perfection than expectancy--the best thing you can ever hope is things as good as you expect it to .
you &apos;re never surprised. because your expectations , my expectations , are domestic .
the secret to happiness--that &apos;s what you all have--the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say--a little carbiographical moment--which i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really beautiful .
i didn &apos;t have better do it. i didn &apos;t go ahead .
but dutch is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of buying a bad jeans when there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re unbounded , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear .
the world is responsible. what could they do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you &apos;re buying one of the disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different species of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they complain .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant sign--not the only thing , but a significant contribution to this explosion of depression , and even suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointing because their standards are so high , and then if you have to explain that experience themselves , you would think it would be your fault .
and so the arousal result is that it &apos;s going to make us better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me recall you .
this is the official dogma , which one we all think is completely wrong. it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it &apos;s not that more choice than something better than something .
there &apos;s a magic amount. i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to improve our pleasure .
now , as a basic question--i &apos;m nearly done--as a basic question , the thing to think about this is , what all these choices enables in the industrialized societies is the material wealth .
there &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem isn &apos;t too big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a special problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and trouble : steve levitt told them yesterday that these expensive and hard to make car seats don &apos;t help .
that &apos;s a money use .
i tell you that these expensive , complicated decisions--it &apos;s not just that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry that we are worse .
if some of the things that people in our society would understand in societies where people have done too little choices , not only improve people &apos;s lives , but also improved our dignity. economists call this an pareto improvement .
income distribution is going to worry about it all better--not just the poor--because all of these big choices are plastic .
&quot; finally , please read this cartoon , and , a high @-@ resolution person says , &quot; &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfishglas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very short view of the world--and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfishglas , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom. they &apos;ve paralysis .
if you break the goldfishglas so that everything is possible , you get the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and they lower the happiness .
everybody needs a goldfishglas .
this is certainly limited to limited--perhaps for the fish , but definitely for us .
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfishglases is a recipe for miserable , and i guess , disaster .
thank you .
