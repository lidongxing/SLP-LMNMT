&quot; a few years ago here at ted , peter skillman asked a design competition called &quot; &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea is quite simple. four @-@ teams need to have the largest freeest structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1 , 000 tape , ca . 1m faden and a marshmallow .
marshmallow has to be up there .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because people &apos;s wired very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , unleashed and architects , even with ctos of fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task , which enables deep impression into nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start orient to the task .
you talk about it , you think it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like power .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they skied and they put spaghetti .
they invest most of their time in the context of growing structures .
&quot; and finally , before you don &apos;t have any time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it on top of the top , and you go back and go , &quot; &quot; ta @-@ da ! admire your work . &quot;
&quot; but then , what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; &quot; is going to be a &quot; &quot; uh @-@ oh , because the weight of marshmallol is confusing that the whole thing is verbing and stops . &quot;
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more uh oh moments than others , and under the worst are fresh bwl .
they lie , they &apos;re using , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re truly confusing .
&quot; and of course , teams have the much more &quot; &quot; ta @-@ da , &quot; &quot; and among the best ones are peacekeepers of the kindergarten . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us peter , not just the highest tower , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how is this ? why ? what about those ?
&quot; and peter said , &quot; &quot; no kids invested time in the spaghetti gmbh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then realizing him .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergarten kids do differently is they start building marshmallow and building prototypes , always with marshmallow at the top , so that they &apos;ve got the opportunity to fix the building .
construction programs recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of an incredible process .
and with each attempt , kids get immediate feedback what works and what doesn &apos; t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , basically--but let &apos;s see how different teams does .
the average for most is about 50cm , bwl students create half of them , lawyers are more , but not much , kindergarten children are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
one is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and themselves @-@ distance geometry are the key to build stable structures .
ceos is about average , but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put a exekutive administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to become more significant .
&quot; it &apos;s incredible. you see around and see , &quot; &quot; this team will win . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can predict that. why is that ?
because they have special skills of the process .
they take the process , they understand him .
and that &apos;s the team that &apos;s set up , and the work goes to work is going to improve the performance of the teams .
specialists and processes and their combinations and their combinations .
if you have 10 teams that &apos;s going to make typical , you &apos;ve got about six that have stable structures .
now , i tried something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the signature .
so i &apos;m a piece of $ prize in software for the profit .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this happened. not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a 2.5 @-@ inch construction construction , he was wearing the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now , understand the benefit of the prototyping .
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they made the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s so profound lessons for us , about the natural and success .
you may ask : why would anyone invest a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is to identify them hidden assumptions .
because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a shared language , or a conversation to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who care about it can go to marshmallowchge. com visit .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build marshmallows .
there &apos;s a step @-@ for @-@ step show there .
you find crazy examples from all over the world , like people optimize the system .
there &apos;s also world record as well .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a connective sport .
it requires that we all represent our senses to the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , like our emotions and ourselves , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that it takes us from a uh @-@ oh moment to a ta @-@ da moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we as if we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted @-@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose because i asked my friends in the last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
&quot; i don &apos;t know. they wanted to go back before there were cars or twitter or &quot; &quot; america &apos;s search for the superstar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re sort of going to the nostalgia , you &apos;re going to be able to think about .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventure .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the great time ever in the planet anywhere else , no matter what scales they &apos;re empowering : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , sinkende disease rates .
there was never been a time before .
my great grandparents died as they were 60 .
my grandparents are the number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the tv .
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it. this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox. smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet .
they reinforce the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone. they &apos;re gone .
we set them up. puff .
in the rich world , disease exist , millions of us have only threatened only one generation yet .
diphterie , reds , children &apos; slahmung . . .
anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success of scientific methods .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to look at things , see if it works , if it doesn &apos; t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , there &apos;s a billion people around the world to go hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s increasing very quickly , and that &apos;s swallow .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to admire this world .
drinking water , great land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos--innovators we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without rape the country where they live on .
i think we can feed this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy them at the same time .
i really think that , and no , that &apos;s not a wish .
but this is what i think night--one of the things that hold me at night , we &apos;ve never really needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of an amazing , amazing event on many areas , and yet , i really think we had to go back hundreds and 300 years ago to go back to find a time where we &apos;ve got progress , where we &apos;ve been given about these things more than now .
people are in their faith , and that &apos;s how they can &apos;t liberate them .
not even the truth will liberate it .
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right on his mind ; even a right on its opinion .
but do you know where do you don &apos;t have a right ?
you don &apos;t have a right on your own facts . &apos; t sweeping , you don &apos; t .
and i needed a while to find that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to resist on resistance , on resistance to what &apos;s the most effective measure in health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gentechnual food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
&quot; so i &apos;ve written a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; &quot; frankenfood , &quot; &quot; why they thought that molecules were going to be a random way around a random way of random . &quot;
but you know , i do what i do. i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worried about why , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me even crazy at all .
these were invisible people , educated people , educated people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me through that way . . .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
we talk about it .
&quot; we &apos;re talking ironic of it with small leaders : &quot; &quot; progress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons for that , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have lost the confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
tschernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the u. s. presidentswahl 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they had always right. so , be skeptical .
ask questions , desire they &apos;re evidence , desire to be evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now , if you get evidence , you have to assume that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that we &apos;re now living in a epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully we &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that brought the autism epidemic with the masern , brave , and red vaccines in connection .
very fearful .
well , researchers have been done to see if that &apos;s true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers should be done , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a serious issue . &quot;
the data came in .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equal , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference. it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the u. s. is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine sins for masern .
this is scandalos , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is we could do that .
well , i understand that. i do .
because did anybody here ?
does one in the audience have ever seen anybody dying ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but 160 , 000 times in the world last year .
these are many deaths through masern , 20 an hour .
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can hurt it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and predict messages from fear and analphabetism like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect and correlate .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never are the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he &apos;s liberating us from one of the worst awarenesss of humanity .
no fears , children &apos; slahmung , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 400 , 500 , 000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul goes around and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should stop jamhs .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul speaks to a public bakery , he can &apos;t make up without armed whales .
he &apos;s getting calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are infinity .
you take it back , you go back the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have masern in this country now .
and that &apos;s worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of masern .
what about kids do ? do we take that. why not ?
a commiliated of mine written me a few weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a little too swim .
no one ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t be immunized their children against children. no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s flu , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have children yesterday in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone in lagos tomorrow in a plane today , and it &apos;s just going to go to los angeles right now , right now .
and in a few hours , he landed and mietet a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzed disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet we live on. don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love ourselves. we love that .
do you have all your vitamins today ?
echinacea , a little bit of antioxidantium that helps you go to the jump .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference how often we figure out they &apos;re useful .
and the data is all the time .
they lose their urine. they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally wrong with you .
dark urine. dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand--we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate one too strong government. we don &apos;t have a system trust .
and we shouldn &apos; t. our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and sealentotend self that can afford it .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re walking into the poor of the placebo industry .
that &apos;s great. i love the placebo industry .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is mix , and we spend billions of dollars for that .
and i have all kinds of little requisite here .
no one of them--gingko , cheat , cheetahs , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheaper .
&quot; and you know what ? when i say that , i write people and say , &quot; &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do what you want . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you know what ? you have injustice .
&quot; because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s healthcare , which says , &quot; &quot; hmm , i won &apos;t assume the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; &quot; or any cancer quacksalber who wants to treat his patients with coffee . &quot;
if you give up this way where belief and magic and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he took 400 , 000 of his people , because he insisted that red started , knoblauch and quotes are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can brake aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is worse than any other of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them. they always have them .
now , the brain @-@ oses epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absurd battle between the answers of economic economic food and the bio elite .
this is a idiotic debate. you have to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , over metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every rice , every branch of petersilie , every rosenkohl , was changed by people .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
there was no eye @-@ loupe melones. there was no christmas trees. we did it all .
we did it in the last 11 , 000 years .
and some of them worked and some of them don &apos; t .
we &apos;re deleting what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it precisely , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re going to live in the same way that we &apos;re going to change food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right. let &apos;s see that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , moral , patentkram .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a real thing , and it &apos;s about millions of people from the islands .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to build 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
gentlemen. shave .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them it .
and why ? svaly changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this eradication stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about a potatoes .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories. it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people could eat that and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice. it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes around ?
it &apos;s not about moving genes around. it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insights on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing that as far as we &apos;re doing something guilty that we , i think , don &apos;t want to be guilty , high @-@ tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
&quot; so after that incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; &quot; do you want to go to this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway. that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move it down where we want it , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time engine , and in the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it turns me , that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you. thank you .
when steve lopez , columnist of los angeles times , one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who played on a violin that had two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steves article about this later , a book that was filmed with robert downey junior than steve lopez and jamie foxx as a nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrabassisten , who studied on juilliard
nathaniel left juilliard , rolled up a nerveal breakthrough , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to recommend all of you to read the book or look at the film so that they &apos;re not just understanding the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how she finally became the instrument when this word is allowed to get the nat
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney concert hall .
he &apos;d just heard about beethoven &apos;s first and fourth sinfonie , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very high and social sound about yo @-@ yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how dodgers never would make it into the baseball world series , and all because of the tuckic passage of the first step in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth sinfonie .
we came to talk about music , and a couple of days later , i got a email in which i got nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel has been able to make a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electricalchocks and thorazin and handschell , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
now , as a consequence of that , he &apos;s particularly random for these schizophrenan phasen , and they &apos;re so bad that they &apos;re drowning it and they &apos;re walking around the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and torture of his own mind .
and in just such a richer , nathaniel , when we started with our first class of education in the walt disney concert hall , he &apos;d lost this irre flackern in his eyes .
he talked about invisible dams and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison in sleep .
i was scared , not myself , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could assure him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to him when i started talking about tons and arpeggios and other exciting shapes of the didaktic
so i started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a completely change .
it was like he stood under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical response whose catalyst was my game .
nathaniel manic anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and he began to play some clips of violin companies and then asked me to end them : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
we started talking about music , starting from trees about beethoven , brahms , bridge and all the other bs , from bartok to the train station .
and i realized that he had not only had an encyclopedia about music , but also with her a tightly personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding i &apos;ve only heard of my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles .
by talking about music , talking about music , was made of this paranoid , confused man who was still moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , excellent , in juilliard ausgebildeter musicians .
music is medicine. music changes us .
for nathaniel , music soul is health .
because the music allowed him to introduce his thoughts and walls with help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he &apos;s going to unleashed his distraction .
i understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
and that &apos;s the reason why we make music : so we do something that has all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity for reality .
and the reality of that expression is all of us , and move , inspired us .
what nathaniel anging , so the music brought him back to a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who realized him he recognized his talent and started it .
and i &apos;m going to keep with nathaniel musi , whether in the walt disney concert hall or in skid row , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you. thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i &apos;ve stolen the cellist .
i hope you disturbing me .
i am jane mcgonigal. i design computer games .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , how to save online games .
i have a plan for that. i want to convince more people , including all of you , spend more time with play bigger and great games .
now , we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
&quot; some of you might think , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but actually , my research at the institute of the future , is the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time needs at 21 billion hours a week .
now , this seems to be a little bit wrong , so i repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
playing to the end of the next decade. no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this image describes pretty much .
why i believe that games are so unexpected for the survival of human species in the future. seriously .
this is a photographer &apos;s photographer phil toledano ride .
he wanted to start the feelings playing , so he built a camera in front of the player .
this is one of the classic expression in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably going to see this sense of urgency , something scared , but also extremely concentration , in a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;re going to see some nuances here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows are surprised .
this is a player who &apos;s standing on the edge of an epic siege .
oh , you know that. ok. prima .
so we have some player here .
a epic victory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t even know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination. and if they reach it , they &apos;re shocked .
that they &apos;re actually capable of able to do that. this is a epic .
this player is about a epic victory .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to see on millions of problems around the world , when we &apos;re taking the hurdles of the next century , the face of the facialness of all the widrigkeits on the edge of a epic siege .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
&quot; i call it the &quot; &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
&quot; that &apos;s me , how i do that &quot; &quot; in life i am bad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph. d. why we &apos;re in play better than we are in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good at play .
and i don &apos;t mean less successful , even though it &apos;s heard .
we reach more in games .
i mean good at the relationship with motivation to do something meaningful , inspired each other .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are turning into our best version , every time and instantly , hardnackig are trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , trying to try it again .
and in reality , if we fail , if we put it on obstacles , we often feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed. we feel threatened. we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or frustrated .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they don &apos;t have them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach anything ?
how can we translate these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment for the community problem .
and i discovered some things that are going to make the epic siege in online worlds .
so first , if you go to one of these online games , especially with world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to convert you to a planet mission immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fit perfectly in your current level , right ?
so they do that .
you never get a job you can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of your skills , so you have to deal with .
but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft , and you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re talking about it , and there &apos;s always a little bit important to do something important .
and there &apos;s a bunch of employees .
wherever they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to join their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in the real life , that feeling that at a fingertiped fingertips are willing to be ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re going to get this whole positive feedback .
&quot; you &apos;ve heard of &quot; &quot; level high &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; + 1 stronger &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; + 1. intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
if i &apos;m going to leave that stage , i don &apos;t talk about + 1 , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback during the real life .
so , the problem of cooperation online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so comfortable to stand at the edge of a epic siege , that we &apos;re trying to spend our entire time in these games .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until now , all world of warcraft players have spent five and 93 million years together to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it might sound ubel .
but to see it in context : five and 93 million years ago , our first primates began to go upright .
so the first owner of primate .
okay , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it makes sense when you think about the time in terms of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out that by using all this time , we &apos;re going to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
we develop ourselves too common thinking , heart failure .
that &apos;s the truth. i believe it .
now , look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average young man today in a country today is using 10 , 000 hours of online games to the 21st of life .
so 10 , 000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10 , twenty hours are the exact total time that they spend in school from five grade to high school--if you never lack. so here we have a complete one .
parallel training , the young people are learning exactly what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
&quot; and maybe some of you read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; &quot; overflieger , &quot; &quot; so you know your theory of success , the theory of success of success . &quot;
it &apos;s based on the great science of cognitive science that , if we spend 10 , 000 hours to the trash of a subject to the 21st of life , we &apos;re going to master to it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a completely generation of young people who are mastery player .
&quot; so the big question is , &quot; &quot; what are players mastery good ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never have before before available human potential .
so many people we have currently in the world that spend at least an hour a day with online games .
these are our mastery player , 500 million people who are extraordinary in something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion player that are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry developed concepts that save energy and work on mobile networks instead of the broadband internet so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect a additional billion player in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion player .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is to make us make these games .
here are the four things i found. first of all , dringlichkeits optimism .
ok , imagine this as extreme self @-@ potential .
dringlichkeits optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to master hurdles , with the belief that we have a underlying hope on success .
players always believe that a epic is possible , and that it &apos;s always worthwhile to try and try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are mastery in the spider poets of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve dropped us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that somebody else with us , that the rules are going to be raised , that we &apos;ve got the same goal , and we &apos;ve got to play with it .
so this enables together to grow and trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happiness. fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft play 22 hours a week , as a part @-@ time job .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than we &apos;re relaxing or do nothing .
we know that as human beings , we work optimal when we &apos;re doing hard , important work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epische meaning .
player love to become part of the most honest science of the world .
here &apos;s a background information to spin the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki in the world with nearly 80 , 000 entries is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they made more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other issue in every other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , and players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who think they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real problem .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a people scientist .
his work is brilliant. he studied why .
people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
&quot; and he says , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a mass journal in virtual worlds and online games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist. so it &apos;s logically .
and he says . . . not just like me . . . i &apos;m a little bit of play , i &apos;m a little bit pregnant .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players in online worlds can achieve more than in real life .
you can knit stronger social attributes than real life , you get more feedback and reward in games than real life .
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal debate .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event to go back 2 , 500 years .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from sheep cracks. you know ?
before these fantastic toys , there were schafsknochels .
and these were the first of people developed toys , and if you &apos;re familiar with the idea of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you might know this story. the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games were invented , in the kingdom of lydien , during the famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of lydien determined to a crazy idea .
people were fighting. people fought .
it was a extreme situation. you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the root game and simplify a national strategy. one day you would eat. the next day you would play .
and they would be so intriguing in the root game , because games are so intriguing and surrounded us with happiness , happiness productivity , that they were forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play. and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by playing it on a day and the next one .
just as i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we put games in order to escape the suffering of the real world , and we play games to make everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that in real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine wouldn &apos;t be better , so the king decided to create a last root game .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a root game , and the seals were allowed to break up to a epic adventure .
they left lydien and they were looking for the search for a new home , and they just pulled back as many people to survive , and they were looking for the rest of the rest they could live in .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but newest dna evidence show that the etrusker , which later the rome rich , the same dna as the old lydier .
so scientists recently came to address that herodotus &apos;s crazy story actually .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
maybe they &apos;ve saved their people through play by dying for 18 years and then had this environment and learned so much about each other , that they saved all the civilization .
so we can .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first one in real time .
the world of warcraft series. this was 16 years ago .
they played worms for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
so , they sent half of their civilization search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion play hours a week .
we should prepare that half of us spend an hour a day , until we solve the problems of real world .
&quot; i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; how do we solve problems of real world . &quot;
&quot; in play ? &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been thinking about for the last few years of the future . &quot;
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it pushs how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people to empower this idea into reality .
we imagine epic siege , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try and try to make people epic siege in their own future .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; world without oil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game is 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you &apos;ve got to overcome a oil .
the oil is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough online content so it &apos;s going to be realistic for them , and they &apos;re actually living their real life without oil , so if you &apos;re going to go to the game , tell us where you live , and then you get news movies in real time
how transportation is being closed , whether schools are closed , and they have to figure out how to make their real life when it &apos;s true , and we ask them to blogging about it , videos or photos .
we tested this game with 1 , 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been tested it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
&quot; but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll go out of oil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players have learned in the game .
so for the next worlds , we &apos;ve created a greater , higher goal than just oil .
we developed the game superstruct institute for the future .
in fact , the calculation of a supercomputers is that people have only left 23 years on the planet left .
&quot; this supercomputer is called &quot; &quot; global sensitivity sensitivity system , &quot; &quot; of course . &quot;
the call to play , we &apos;ve designed almost like a jerry bridge film .
you know , jerry bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team. you have the astronauts , the scientist , the ex @-@ punishment , and you can save them together .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in dream team , and it &apos;s our job to create energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice .
8 , 000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google superstruct .
and the last game we bring out on the 3. march. it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
&quot; if you finish the game , you get the record from the world bank , &quot; &quot; social transcripts , &quot; &quot; abschluss 2010 . &quot;
we &apos;re working with universities in all black africa , and we &apos;re using them to learn social transmitted .
we have a comic to do it. we have a level high for regionales , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to put them all together to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in development objects that benefit together to imagine their own social practices to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t rescued the real world yet .
well , i hope that they agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happiness productivity , the ability to make tight social networks , dringlichkeits optimism and the desire for epi scientists .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing with significant games to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me and play with me .
so if i look forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things that we can create any imagination , and that we can play all kinds of games. so i &apos;m saying , let &apos;s start the world @-@ changing games .
thank you .
&quot; i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect since then , and it &apos;s weird that a magician interested in it , it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s like me , &quot; &quot; a divergence that will be real when somebody &apos;s only enough believe enough . &quot; &quot;
in other words , sugar bonds have shown a messable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what you &apos;re going to happen is a pharmaceutical or a kind of . . . in the pain of pain , for example , there &apos;s only when the patient only believe
a deception becomes something real because somebody does it .
so to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you a fundamentally , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works. this is a trick that &apos;s been at least since the 1950s in every magic for children .
i learned it from the cub scout magic of the pathfinder in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like this in my axe .
i shoot my arms back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my arms or out of him , i &apos;m just going to express my hands up here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving around , as long as i express here , nothing can change or come out in my arms .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , knocks through my naked magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting there on his place that i can shake it without the knife down .
nothing goes into my arms or come out , no trickli. and you can study everything .
ta @-@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in this room know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going to leave my hands to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my arms disappear or out there , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i find my hands , is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
the moment i &apos;m going to go away from you , so you can see them from back , this finger here , my shower , just where he was , in a position where he was so extinct .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here. exactly .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a divergence , why you &apos;re not true that down here are just three fingers : because the way it &apos;s made of information , they don &apos;t pay one , one , two , three , but you see it as a group .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about now. and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my shower , which is now there .
and when i go to my hand , the same thing is going to go back to me by walking through that movement , that the finger goes back .
i take this hand away. and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can do their friends and neighbors. thank you .
now , what has that to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago or something , i read a study that really got me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
it turns out that if you offer a placebo in form of a white pill , in the form of aspirintablette , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a specific effect .
but if you put the shape where you put placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue colors and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually messable effective .
and that , even though not any of these pharmaceuticals . . . it &apos;s just sugarpilling .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me look like .
but it turned out that that &apos;s not all that .
when you take the capsule , the even more effective than pigeons every form .
a color capsule that &apos;s yellow and on the other red , is better than a white cap .
also the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills--i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics. sorry .
but the key thing is , . . .
. . . that also also play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to store the needle .
right ? a syringe with a effective substance--a few milliliter of a effective substance that you inject a patient .
it creates a very strong image in your head. it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really . . . i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the needle .
and nothing of it has some really pharmaceutical property. it &apos;s only our belief that we have in a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to go to the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a 18 centimeter long hutnadel. it &apos;s very , very spitz. and i &apos;m going to die a little bit of sterilizing .
this is really my meat. it &apos;s not damian special meat .
this is my skin. this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stumbled this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going through it through it until they &apos;re focusing on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to submit--if you &apos;re easy in ohnmacht--i &apos;ve done this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s got a woman almost ohnmachtable .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to get quick , you &apos;re looking for the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first fierce part back here .
you can see it in the same , but you can look away when you want .
so , it &apos;s right here where my meat started , at the bottom part of my arms , i &apos;m just going to just make a little shot .
does sorry. does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , again .
now we &apos;re in the same situation that we &apos;ve had messertrick .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t pay my finger , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you. this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
&quot; they say , &quot; &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not as stupid , and it &apos;s about the skin , just to hold us for a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like here ? pretty good .
&quot; yeah , i know. and people say , &quot; &quot; okay. i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people in the side spaces are coming in .
let me show you a little bit .
this is really my skin. this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
sorry. if you &apos;re going to submit , look away , don &apos;t look .
&quot; the people backwards or the ones that see this later on video will say , &quot; &quot; well , it looks pretty powerful , but if it was real , here &apos;s a hole , there &apos;s a hole , it would be flower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle there and go from stage .
we &apos;re going to face a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward. thank you .
so i realized a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
the first one that was more like a passionate of affare .
it was a beautiful fish , well @-@ known , good accountable , conversationful , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
better , in aquaculture , he &apos;d be attacked after the supposedest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss of the company called and asked if i could talk to a event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , &quot; &quot; i said . &quot;
here was a company trying to solve what has become this unpredictable problem for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our menu ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve taken the oceans like we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to convince the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the healing , the salmon , the salmon , heavyfish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably , or ubel aquaculture , fisheries , is part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it. fish pollution the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna. a big disability .
he has a feed of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wildfish to be needed to get a pound of layer .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
day before the event , i called the head of public for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; don , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t grab the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and then he added , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re basically a world . &quot;
&quot; this feed of 2.5 to 1 , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the best in the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 2.5 to one ? what did you feed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; great , &quot; &quot; i said. put up . &quot;
and at that evening , i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know. he &apos;s going to ask .
now , i was phoneed with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a special answer , until finally , i finally got a biologist .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; don , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fishhle , and then he said , chicken pellets .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , bone deprivation , jarn , jack and worked with food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; how percentage of your food is chicken ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about available to fish ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was a long pause , and he said , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i went from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self @-@ exaggerated and good job .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i &apos;ve actually come to the fish from that fish , because , i &apos;m swear to god , who &apos;s swore after that entertainment after chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love history .
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way you know better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
first of all , i first eat him in a restaurant in southern india .
an amazing journalist has been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got a bit wrong .
he came to the table with a bright , almost scanning white color .
the chef had dropped him .
hold twice .
amazingly he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it would be done ?
i can &apos; t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel. in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cooked the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef. at least on the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish shot in the southwest spanish spaniens .
it &apos;s near the bottom of the rivers of guadalquivir .
until the 1980s , the farm was the hands of argentina .
they raised meat on what was basically wetsuit .
they made this by watering the country .
they built this complicated consequence of kanalen , and they pulled out water out of the country and out into the river .
now , you couldn &apos;t make sure that that &apos;s not economic .
and ecological was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds for this location .
and so 1982 has bought a spanish company with environmental awareness .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve got the flow of the water .
they literally gave the lever .
instead of using water , they used the channels to put the water back again .
they started the channels .
they created a 11 , 000 acres of fish--barsch , sea bottle , shrimp , aal--and they have miguel and his company completely reverse the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re taking out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you &apos;re seeing are diminished channels and these density , ultraviolet march .
i was there no longer time with miguel ago .
&quot; he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; &quot; a crocodile for kissing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay ? so there we were and fighting us through the wetlands , and i &apos;m flipping and sweat , have matcally to my knees , and miguel hold a biology .
here he lifted a rare gleitaar .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out miguel spent the greatest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how it has become such a fish experts .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then he goes , and there &apos;s more of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unprecedented , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with love .
and my head became faint about this little bit of delicious fish that i had ahead of .
&quot; so i missed him. i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , what &apos;s it that your fish tastes so good ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; &quot; &quot; i know young , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . &quot;
but what does your fish eat ?
&quot; how about feed feed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , he &apos;s left to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eats what you would eat in the wild .
the plantful biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ protective .
there &apos;s no food .
anybody heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
&quot; later on that day , i went around with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment , it was as if a filmregisseur had a stage for a stage .
and we bow around the corner , and we are the most incredible view , thousands and thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literally pink carpet so far the eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; look at your farmers , pink . &quot;
&quot; they &apos;re swimming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shit ? i was completely confused .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish for the bird . &quot;
well , last year , 600 , 000 birds , over 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest one , and one of the most important private bird reserve in all of europe .
&quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t a good thorough bird sense the last one you want to have on a fish ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he shake his head , no .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re excited , not intense . &quot;
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eats the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
&quot; so the pinker of the builder the better the system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about that. a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a fisherman , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , this flamingos of prescription shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they removed in a city of 240 kilometers where the soil unit is better for nesting .
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to farm .
and every evening you fly back 240 kilometers .
they do that because they can follow the white line of the landscape of a92 .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , you fly 240 kilometers to the farm , and then you fly 240 kilometers back to the evening ? &quot;
&quot; do that for children ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked at me when i was just quoted a song of whitney houston .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; no. you do that because food is better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish. i don &apos;t like it. i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this leg , sales taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southspanien , she didn &apos;t taste after fish .
she tasted cute and rein , as if you would take a bit of the ocean .
i mentioned that against miguel and he nicd .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; the skin works like a sponge . &quot;
she &apos;s the last gun before something in the body .
&quot; it &apos;s developed over the course of evolution to look unconditioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and then he added to him , &quot; &quot; but our water has no unimaginable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay. a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures her success at success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no unimaginable , he &apos;s understated because the water that &apos;s coming through this farm from the river of guadalquivir here .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that rivers are today to lead them with , chemical pollutants , impacting pests .
and if it &apos;s taken through the system , and that &apos;s the water cleaner than it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that misss their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water on the water , not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water comes out , it assures it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and they should do it , because these love history , as romantic as it is , is also exploring .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future whether we &apos;re talking about bars or meat cortex .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , actually tasted well .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
we are not realists , we enjoy. we are lovers .
we love weekends. we love small families--we talk about regional food. we eat bio .
&quot; and if you claim that these are the things that the future of good food keeps somewhere up and says , &quot; &quot; hey people , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
&quot; how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re making enough calories to feed the world more than just .
one billion people will starve today .
one billion--that &apos;s more than ever before--because of crazy inequality , not the total production .
now , i don &apos;t like that question , because it has the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
&quot; feeds of plants , pests of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chickens on the earth , chickens of fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has asked , &quot; &quot; if we feed more people cheap , how terrible can it be ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the movement. it was the law. it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a framework in development , a materialius , that &apos;s rapidly environmental capital that enables exactly this production .
that &apos;s not a framework , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our bodies today is threatening not because of abnehmender , but because of abnormal resources .
not through the latest mahdrescher and tractor inventions , but through fruit country , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chains , but by forests , and not by fishboats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that relate every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industry model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are up there , and it never produced something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model instead .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking back at two billion years of jobs .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
operating that aren &apos;t worlds , operatingness that are rebuild instead of abuse , operating , the extensiv , instead of intensive , farmers that are not only tools , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
i grew up with a part of science fiction .
in my school , i &apos;m at the bus to school every day a hour .
and my nose is always in a book , a science fiction book that made my thought in other worlds , and in telling my profound way , my deep in me , satisfying curiosity .
&quot; and this curiosity also showed that when i was not in school , through the forests of struggling , migrating and &quot; &quot; samples , &quot; &quot; frogs and coffee and ponds and ponds and ponds , everything brought home and under the microscope . &quot;
i was totally excited , you know .
it was always trying to understand the attempt to understand the world and make the limits of possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to resist in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explore the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating program that showed us animals and places and a world of wonderful that we never imagine before .
that &apos;s probably what &apos;s going on with the science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw. i could paint .
and since there was neither video games still with computer tags , i had to create the whole screen in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my mind .
we all had to do that at that time. when we read a book , we took the description of the autors , and we put it on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , spaces and all that .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , as i hidden behind textbooks .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and what happened was something interesting about jacques cousteauss fascinated me was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
i certainly wouldn &apos;t have to reach out a alien world with a spacecraft , and that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in here on earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic as all the stuff i &apos;d always introduced when i read this books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided to be diving .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 000 kilometers from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let it go .
i &apos;m nervous my father , until finally he had made a dove school in buffalo , new york , looked extinct , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3 , 000 hours underwater , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep oceans , even in the meat oceans , is so rich in fascinating life as we can really imagine it .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , smart human imagination .
until today &apos;s days , i feel deepest honest for what i see on my dive .
and my love with the ocean , with the same intensity like eh and je .
when i looked at a job as an adult , it was the movies .
that seemed the best way of telling my inner drang telling stories , with my need to create images , to unite .
as a child , i used to draw comic books all the time .
so films of the way to bring pictures and stories together. that fits together .
&quot; of course , the stories i &apos;ve been looking out of the science fiction area : &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; abyss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i could connect my prescription for the underwater world and the dive with the films .
so my two passions sort of fell in .
&quot; something interesting happened in &quot; &quot; abyss &quot; &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this film--we had to create some kind of liquid water--we put it on computer generated animation , cg , back . &quot;
what came out was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure that ever was in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , and in fact , he played his production costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized from magic that came from it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , there &apos;s no longer advanced technology and magic doesn &apos;t tell anymore anymore .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that exciting .
&quot; and i thought to myself , &quot; &quot; wow , that needs to be in the movie artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so we went to &quot; &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; &quot; my next film , even further . &quot;
along with ilm , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success is about how this effect would come .
and it worked again. again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , there was a very new world , a whole new world of creativity for film damage .
&quot; so i started a company with my good friend stan winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designers called &quot; &quot; digital domain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic idea of this company was to translate the analoger processes with opera printers , etc. and start starting with digital production .
and then we did that , and we &apos;re going to make a time for a competition .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that in the creature and the character design , we actually founded the company--to slow down .
&quot; i &apos;d written this piece of &quot; &quot; avatar , &quot; &quot; which should be visual effects of visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects in all new high effects , with realistic human , exaggerated characters that have been made by cg , and the mainfiguren should be all cg . &quot;
but the messlatte looked very nice back , and the people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
so i understand that , and i made this other film about the great ship that goes .
&quot; the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship &quot; &quot; and it became a lovely film of epic . &quot;
but in fact , i really wanted to go down to the real crack of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth. the studio didn &apos;t know .
&quot; but i &apos;ve convinced you by saying , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve got to the wreck. we &apos;ve filmed the real wreck . &quot;
we &apos;re going to show it in the adult sequence of the film .
&quot; that &apos;s really important. it &apos;s a good curtain for marketing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and i &apos;m excited to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy. but that comes back to that , the imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , a reality where i found myself in a russian divergence , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a bullauge .
this wasn &apos;t a film , no hd , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really excited about me .
and we had to build cameras , and we had to build cameras and make it possible .
and i noticed how much these deep sea dives were similar to space .
well , they were also highly efficient planning .
you get into that capsule , you &apos;re floating down into this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t get it back .
&quot; and i thought , &quot; &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s really cool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part to do with curiosity and science. it was all. it was adventure , it was curiosity. it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
at some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , there was no words .
so that &apos;s really about me , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
&quot; after the success of &quot; &quot; titanic , &quot; &quot; i told myself , &quot; &quot; okay , i want to lay my chief as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and i &apos;m going to go for a while @-@ time researcher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then we started planning these expeditions .
&quot; we &apos;re going to dive to &quot; &quot; bismarck , &quot; &quot; and explore them with robots . &quot;
we went back to the titanic wrack .
we took small robots that we built , which had a fiberglasl .
our intention was to go inside and look at the interior of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explore the inner of the wracks. you didn &apos;t have any means , so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and see planken , who &apos;s pretty similar to these dots here , and i know that einst played the band there .
and i &apos;ll fly with a little robotic vehicle through the gange of the ship .
i &apos;m just really concerned about it , but my mind is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the shipwrack of the titanic table .
this was the surrealste form of a deja vu that i ever experienced , because before i go around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light cycle of the vehicle , because i was running over months ago when we turned the movie .
the set was a precise copy of the bauplane of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made this telepresence experience that you use such robotic avatars , and you can use your consciousness in the vehicle , in those other shapes of existence .
it was really profound .
and perhaps a little bit about what might happen in a few decades if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or to do other things in all sorts of post @-@ human futures that i can imagine as a science fiction fan .
after these expeditions , we began to really appreciate what we &apos;ve seen down , for example , these deep oceans , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals. these are sort of aliens , but here &apos;s earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on how we do that .
and so you can see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius .
water clouds live. and you can &apos;t imagine that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science science @-@ fiction influence from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are dealing with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting right now and they &apos;re going to go ahead and eat right space emissions , and they go through russia , through the mission , the biomedical protocol of everything from everything , and then
that was fascinating .
but at the end of that , i took space scientist with us in the deep sea .
and i took them with them , and i got them down to the world : astrobiologists , planet scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the source so they could look at samples and test instruments and so on .
we turned documents , but actually , science , actually said , space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , when i was a kid , and the conditions in reality .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i also learned a lot about leadership .
now , you &apos;re sure , a director also needs to lead , be a leader like a shiplets or something .
but i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i answer these expeditions .
&quot; because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
&quot; why am i doing that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
these bubble movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the production costs. it &apos;s not a trace .
&quot; everybody think i &apos;ve been gone between &quot; &quot; titanic &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; avatar , &quot; &quot; and somewhere i &apos;d put the nail on a row on a row . &quot;
i &apos;ve made all these films , this documentary , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money. what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it to the task will , to the challenge of will--and the ocean is the challenging environment that there are. you &apos;re doing it of the discoveries because of , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months behind each other .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the mind that you have in front of each other , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
&quot; and if you go back to the country , and you say , &quot; &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the sound surveillance , and the whole thing , all the technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on sea , &quot; &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the other ,
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
&quot; so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; &quot; avatar , &quot; &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you need to respect your team and deserve your respect . &quot;
that &apos;s what the dynamics really changed .
&quot; so i stood back with a little team on unknown terrain , and we &apos;re called &quot; &quot; avatar &quot; &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before . &quot;
unfortunately .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a period of four and a half years to a right family .
it changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who thought we were really good at this ocean and transporting the planet pandora .
to me , it was more a principle of doing my job , the real process that changed in the result .
so what can we close from all this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think first is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the mind of your team is more important than all the lorbees of the world .
&quot; to me , young filmmakers , they say , &quot; &quot; give me a rat i can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and i say , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t get yourself . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a others for you. don &apos;t stop yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nasa has such an favorite one : &quot; &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the art and the study in the study , it &apos;s got to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a confidence there .
none of the important consequences that innovation would ever be done without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to share with you on the way. failure is a alternative , fear is not. thank you .
if i want to share one of the things that i want to share with you today is that the totalness of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their determination , and instead of thinking about information , i want you to think about how we can use information , that we can benefit that pattern and
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagram of older age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a particular cause , say we &apos;re wrong .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes you .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the world , people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here over here .
we can go out a step further , and we can relax the data then and see that the cycle chain and cancer are the usual , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and go older , say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents is even the main cause that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s noticed that this is particularly true of men .
so you realize that the view of information and data in this way is very swim in a living information world .
and if we can do this for raws , why not for content itself ?
&quot; what we &apos;ve got here is the cover of every single &quot; &quot; sports illustrated , &quot; &quot; which have ever been printed . &quot;
it &apos;s all here. it &apos;s all online .
you &apos;d like to test it after my talk in their room .
with pivot , you can go to a decade .
you can go into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular task .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this task and the sports species .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click here , i &apos;m all excited about what lance armstrong is mentioned .
&quot; now , if i just want to get a sense of mind , i could think , &quot; &quot; ok , what if i look at all the bikes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
so i go back to a step back and expand the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that when you search through that kind of information , gezielter , broader , clean , smoking , you don &apos;t just add or surft .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with about what a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and reduce it on a little summary .
the summary contains a short overlooked and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the popularest wikipedia page .
but even in this limited view , we can do lots of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are popularest on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
&quot; now , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i realize that the wikipediakategories , most of the time magazines are the &quot; &quot; people of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipedia .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
&quot; looking at a particular one of these collapses , i can go into the theme of time magazines , &quot; &quot; people of the year , &quot; &quot; and see everybody together . &quot;
now , if i look at all these people now , i think the majority of government are government--some of them come from science. some , less , coming out of economics. here &apos;s my boss. and one comes from music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing in the web as though it &apos;s really a nice , not just side to side , but a lot of abstract .
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i &apos;ll just show you just the new york times website .
pivot , this application--i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not an browser , but you can look at websites with this--and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back and jump right into a specific vision .
so that &apos;s important because you can only look through the web website in this kind of way , and you can look at all the internet cycle in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular time .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been running up here .
and i can sort of look at everything i &apos;ve looked at today .
and , if i go back to a step , and i look at everything , maybe i can redesign my course after my addiction , and here , i looked for a nepotistisch , here &apos;s bing , or here , live labs pivot .
and from here i can go into the page and put them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used again , and every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think data is a flight .
we &apos;re talking about the flight of the information cycle .
we &apos;re talking about drowning information .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head so that instead of walking from one another , instead of starting to go from many things to many things , and recognize patterns that otherwise have happened ?
if we can do that , then these sophisticated data will become a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get it .
and if we know , then we can even pull wisdom from that .
so i stopped , thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people pay the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these tides of work , there are several cognitive cases that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive cases .
it &apos;s true for louder that think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re as much as everybody else .
the first of these cases is a resilient to give complexity .
it turns out that happiness is just not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain importance that we could make it , but in the big and all of that is something we need to be stopped , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what &apos;s well @-@ being .
the second cases is a sense of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between being happy in his life and happiness about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about an circumstances that affect well without distorted its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cases .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer sitting after one of my lectures who reported a story . &#91; unclear . . . . &#93; he said he &apos;d heard a sinfonie , and it was absolutely proper music , and it was at the end of the
and then he added , really quite emotional , that ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos; t .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
they didn &apos;t pay because he was spreading with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he got to keep .
what really tells us is that we could think about us about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a experience that lives in the present and the present knows , is able to experience the past , but basically the present has only been the present .
&quot; it &apos;s the experience of the doctor--you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; &quot; does it hurt when i &apos;m here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory self is that , which is telling us and the story of our lives right now , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor &apos;s working by saying , &quot; &quot; how did you feel ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; or &quot; &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that . &quot;
these are two very different units , the experience itself and the memory itself , and the two of them is part of the notion of happiness .
well , memory self is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really starting with a fundamental response on our memories--it &apos;s starting immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re able to do about our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who are understated a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail. it &apos;s not more painful now , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients. these are their record .
&quot; and you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; who has more loved ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly has more yellow. his representation was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b and more .
&quot; but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; &quot; how much these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse erinn to the representation as patient b .
the stories of the representations were different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of the story as it ends .
and none of these stories are very powerful or great--but one of them is this clear . . . but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the , the worst is , where pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
&quot; because we asked these people after their representation , and also a lot later , &quot; &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the erinn .
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the experience self and the memory self .
from the experience of the experience , b clearly had a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s actually done , and it &apos;s actually done , you could actually extend the representation of patient a .
that &apos;s going to lead that the patient is suffering , but just a little less than before .
and if you &apos;re doing this for a few minutes , you &apos;re confusing that the experience of patients is a bad one , and you &apos;ve gotten that patients &apos; patients are much better , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story about his experience .
what does a story do ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we &apos;re invent .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s signed up to be breakthroughs , important moments and end .
it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , the end .
well , the experience itself lives physically alive .
it has eyes of experience one after another .
and you say , what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple. they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives--and i &apos;ve been excited--you know , psychological present than about three seconds long , which means that there &apos;s about 600 million in a life , in a month , there &apos;s about 600 , 000. most of you don &apos;t leave
most of you are completely ignored by memory itself .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this moment of experience is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use during the world .
and as we consume them , it &apos;s seemingly seemingly important , but that &apos;s not the story that the memory self for us .
so we have the memory self and experience ourselves , and they &apos;re really different .
the greatest difference between them is time .
from the view of the experience itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first one , then the two @-@ week vacation is twice as good as the vacation vacation .
that &apos;s not how that works for memory itself .
for the memory itself , a two @-@ week vacation is hardly better than the housing vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories to be added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that is different from a experience self , and time has very little impact on that story .
now , memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that &apos;s true of choices , because if you have a patient , who , say we had two representations in two different surgeons and decide which to vote , then the one that &apos;s picked up the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos; s
the experience itself has no voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences. we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we usually don &apos;t usually think of our future as an experience .
we think about our future as predictable memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as one , which means that the experience itself needs through experiences that the experience itself doesn &apos;t need .
i have the impression that if we do urlaub is the very common case , which means we make urlaub far away in the service of memory itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to do , i think .
i mean , how much are we going from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done in antarctica a few years ago , the clearly of the best urlaub that i had ever had , and i think relatively often in the relationship of how often i think of other vacation .
and i &apos;ve probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week journey , and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the order with the 600 images , i spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and these are highest a half a half .
there seems to be an impulse .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the time of memory , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , there &apos;s a real question , why are we giving memories so much weight in the way that we &apos;re seeing ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the vacation , all of your images will be raised , and you get an amnestic drug , so that they &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ? and if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think of time , you get a answer , and if you
why we look at the vacation we &apos;re looking at is a problem with a choice between the two kinds of self .
now , the two kinds of self throw up two things from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experience itself ?
and then you would ask yourself : how happy are the moment in life of the experience themselves ?
and they &apos;re all--happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experience of the time .
if you ask the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfying or enjoying the person when these person think about their lives .
very different terms .
everybody who doesn &apos;t have that term is going to convey the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m going to have a lot of researchers about well @-@ being that exploration of happiness have long on exactly the same way .
the distinction between the happiness self and the happiness of memory itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re looking at measuring the two of them .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
and the main lesson that we , i think have learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and you can &apos;t really teach them a lot about how happy he lives and reverse .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about five .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody else has eight on a scale of 10geordnet , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his experience .
so the correlation is small .
we know about what the happiness of happiness itself is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly meant to be satisfied with people we like , spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the conclusion from what i &apos;ve said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really imagine happiness as a commodities for well @-@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t realize about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , as happy as people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier if you say , in ohio , we live in .
and what &apos;s happening is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the experience itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the respect self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the next self is responsible , you can end--some people could go to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who move to california to become happier .
now , your experience itself is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen. you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll remind you about how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well @-@ being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you. i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we set up a couple of weeks ago , they mentioned that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup .
is this something that you can participate in because you &apos;ve got a few minutes ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup polls is a number we had absolutely not expecting .
we found that in terms of the happiness of experience itself .
if we looked at how emotions are playing with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60 , 000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600 , 000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample under a income of 600 , 000 dollars a year .
ca : 60 , 000 .
dk : 60 , 000 .
60 , 000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unfortunate , the poorr they &apos;re going to become .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re getting about is an absolute surface line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen as flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , money hasn &apos;t done one happiness happiness , but that lack of money make surely miserable , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the memory itself , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the more happiness .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
ca : but danny , in the entire american goals , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people were to take this evidence seriously , i mean , it seems to be all about the head , anything we think we believe , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country generally would take a befund like the serious and make politics based on ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will slow down into the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
the people are to admit that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss if they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life ratings , so we need to lead this discussion quite soon .
as you can increase happiness , very different depending on how you think and whether you think of the memory of yourself , or whether you think of the experience itself .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at measure the experience happiness of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , in the next one or two decades , i think , is part of the national statistic .
ca : well , it seems to me , this topic will be , or at least the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my full @-@ time position in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , to provide things that we need and provide to allow the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than anybody else on the planet .
climate change means that their seeds are not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re too much raining , and things are going to change as much as it can &apos;t change their women &apos;s environment .
it leads to hungersterben. it leads to uncertainty. it leads to inadequate .
so , a climate change becomes terrible for them .
also , the energy price is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce just one thing , one thing that you could reduce , it would be energy in most effective .
well , the energy price has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress of energy is based on energy steps .
the kohlerevolution drinks the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electricity , and so we have refrigerators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price--let &apos;s cut the price--we meet a new barrier , and these barriers are related to co2 .
co2 warmed the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they summarize the extinct co2 that leads to temperature , and these temperatures have some very negative consequences , effectively on the weather , and maybe worse , the indian consequence that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt those kinds of kinds of changes , and so all systems together .
well , the exact relationship between a co2 increase and the interaction of temperature and where their other consequences are , there &apos;s a couple of uncomfortable , but not many .
and there &apos;s certainly sure about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
&quot; i asked the top scientists mehrmals : &quot; &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ? &quot;
&quot; isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer is , until we get zero , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than to say , we have a 3.5 high truck that has to be under a 3 meters , and then you can go underneath it .
this has to go down , on zero .
well , we &apos;re spending a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons. people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that flourishing on zero .
it &apos;s so constant .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we have to go from rapid rise to zero .
this equation has four factors. a little bit of multiplication. you have this thing left carbon--which you want to get towards zero , and that &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people , from the service that each person uses average , the average energy for every service and the carbon , which is
so let &apos;s take a look at every factor and think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of those numbers has to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today 6.8 billion people today .
and it &apos;s writing at nine billion. it &apos;s moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive money , we &apos;ve probably been able to lower this about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we &apos;re seeing a rising for 1.3 .
the second factor is the service we use .
that involves everything that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and poverty changes to make these services almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make it waste and use less , but average is going to increase that number every year , and so much more than doubled , the number of service per person will be willing .
so here we see a very fundamental service. is there at home light so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their shoes under the streets .
now , in effectiveness , the e , the energy per service , there are finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
because different successs in the light sector , through other automated , through new methods , there are lots of services that energy can lower them , can be dramatically behave , 103 00 : 05 : 05 : 50 , 000--05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 53 , 000 .
some individual services reduce 90 percent .
in other services , like the idea of fertilizer , 105 00 : 05 : 56 , 000--05 : 05 : 05 : 58 , 000 or the airverkehr or air transportation , the game room for improvements is much smaller .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion on maybe 13 billion tons of ton. and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor--and that &apos;s going to be a key factor--that &apos;s the amount of carbon that is emitting per energy .
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get this on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every shower for electricity is co2 today , except renewable energy and nuclearrgie .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy .
&quot; now , if i use the term &quot; &quot; miracle , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible . &quot;
the microprocessor is a miracle. the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these wonder .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re just wrong , and some people don &apos; t .
but in this case , we have to give up full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this ?
is there a natural illustration , there &apos;s a demonstration of people &apos;s idea here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoos , and somehow people want this .
the idea was really grateful for them , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i got here .
i decided that this was unfortunate by happiness , my year @-@ old contribution would be here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural happiness .
you assure me that it &apos;s not going out. in fact , you &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of toys like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions either either or several who have an unpredictable scale and unpredictability , and even though there are lots of directions where people are looking for , i &apos;m really just seeing five that can afford these big challenges .
i left tide , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
these are perhaps a moderate contribution , and if you afford better than i expect , that would be great , but my core thing here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t stop up because they &apos;re shy , because they &apos;re significant problems .
let &apos;s look at the burning fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there , maybe it &apos;s easy , but it &apos;s not. you had to get all the carbon that comes after the burnstone , start using pressure , and then you hope and hope it &apos;s staying there .
there are some pilot projects that create this on a 60 percent level of 80 percent , but it &apos;s got to get 100 percent very difficult to get a co2 , and it &apos;s a challenge for the co2. but the biggest problem here is the storage question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something , literally , many billion times bigger than any kind of trash you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard use .
next : nuclearrgie .
they also have three big problems too. the cost of high @-@ cost countries are high , and the question of safety that you really feel that you really feel nothing can go wrong despite the human employees that the fuel is not used for guns .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
people have to feel good at that . 184 00 : 10 : 20 , 000--so , 00 : 10 : 10 , 000 , three very difficult problems that might be delete .
so three very difficult problems that maybe matter , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve been trying to draw .
they &apos;re renewable energy as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have--even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel--they have some nights .
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically less than the forces of forces .
these are energy farms , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , thousand times more flat than a normal force .
and also , these sources are underestimated .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it &apos;s as well as the wind is not constantly constantly .
that &apos;s why you have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way to get the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s big preishera challenges here. there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside of the country , they don &apos;t just need to deal with the technology , they also need to deal with the risk that the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the design problem .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , pockets , for everything. and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world. i found that all the batteries that we now produce
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 than the approach to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interconnected sources about saying 20 percent of the consumer .
if you want to go to 100 percent on it , you need an incredible miracle .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
&quot; a &quot; &quot; manhattan project ? how are we going to go ? &quot;
what we need is a lot of companies working on it. hundreds .
every one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many ways , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot in the ted group that are already engaging there .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , one called esolar has the great solar @-@ powered technologies .
invest in a dozen companies in dozen companies that make great things and have interesting possibilities and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i funded a company that maybe surprised the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear collision ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are running around .
the terrapower concept means that instead of an part of the uranium , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it would work , but since then , modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that : yeah ! with the right materials , it looks like it works .
and because you connect these 99 percent , the cost of cost is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a drive .
rather than break the head about it , they just burn it. a great thing .
the ancient one is used to be a little bit like a candle .
&quot; you can see that it &apos;s sort of a column , often as &quot; &quot; wandernde wave reactor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent. you have the part that &apos;s spreading today , so it &apos;s called the ancient uranium .
that triggers the u. s. for hundreds of years .
and if you have oceanwater cheap and just filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should we look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to reach , and then we talk about the between .
a lot of talk about a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there &apos;s still something agriculture , and hopefully forest and time will be clean to it .
so to reach these 80 percent , the industries countries , including countries like china , their electricity policy .
the other note tells whether we use zero emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key issue of this stuff .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the effective effects to get reduction on the way , the less we emittize , the less is going to be the carbon sum and also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which doesn &apos;t completely lead to the great reductions , just equal , or even less important as the other , which is the rapidity of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs , we have to follow full gas , and we can measure this : in corporate projects , in pilot projects and regulation .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this issue .
&quot; the al gore book &quot; &quot; we have the choice and david mckays &quot; &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they really go through it , and they create a framework where this can be wide , because we need support for all sides .
there are some things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific desire that we &apos;re invent this technology .
if you &apos;re just a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose this wish , which is half @-@ sacred energy without co2. that wish i took .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the digits between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be horrible between the united states and china , between the u. s. and poor countries , and almost all of these two billions are going to be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
for what measures i appeal ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like coppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they were supposed to talk to these innovation strategy , and they were spare by the ridiculous amount of money spent for these innovative approach .
we need market incentives , co2 control , cap &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue rational and complete , and also the things that are being taken by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill him .
thank you .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you. thank you .
thank you very much. just to understand terrapower better--first , can you give us an idea of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works , you &apos;re only in 100 million .
the hard steps is building the first reactor to find more billions , the regularia and the place that actually build the first of them .
once the first deal is done when it &apos;s walking like hidden , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic poetry , the energy density is so different from the nuclearrgie as we know it .
ca : so to understand that , that means deep in the ground almost like a vertical mammalian fuel , this consumer uranium , and then the process begins up and works down ?
bg : exactly. today you have to rehabit the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong , and that thing you open it up or out. that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years--think about a column that &apos;s buried without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and it &apos;s been done .
ca : a nuclear reactor that itself offers a solution for the waste .
bg : yeah. well , what happened with the waste : you can sit it--there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method--then take it and pack it in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the trash that exists in these refrigerator or dry content , which is our startpelled .
so what this reactor was a problem for these reactors , which we fill in and so that the garbage will reduce dramatically during this process .
ca : but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where &apos;s the biggest interest , what &apos;s really about ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t set up to a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting open records for everything the nuclear , and there &apos;s great interest and the people of the company were in russia , india , china . . . i &apos;ve been here , and talked about the energy
i &apos;m optimistic. you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a quick reactor and some countries built this , so everybody who &apos;s implemented a rapid reactor , a candidate for our first .
ca : in your imagination : time frame and probability to really call it ?
bg : now , we need one of these scales--straiting things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then to use 20 years .
so that &apos;s sort of the deadline that &apos;s placed us the environment that we need to hold .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of things that are , as much as their approaches work , the demand for their pilots to offer it .
and it would be best when it builds several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
ca : do the big possible breakthrough , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would also be without the environmental therapy , but it &apos;s been so much more important .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular technique , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be hard , but maybe they say about us .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a ancient molecule has a million times as much energy , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , so the
ca : if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to raise emergency action to try to keep the stabil stabil ?
bg : if you come to this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve forgotten too much , and it &apos;s about a heart attack. what do you do then ? you might need a heart attack or anything .
there &apos;s a research research called the geoengineering , which is called different techniques to delay the warming so that we had 20 or 30 years longer to bring us together .
this is just an insurance level .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t have to work on insurance because you might be able to go wrong so that you &apos;re going to eat , because you know , you &apos;re going to save your heart power .
i don &apos;t know if the smart thing is , if you &apos;re the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have to have that , if things come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
ca : climate change : do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
you say there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that are different ?
there are very , very few things that you can say , of which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the main problem here is as similar as aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later--and that &apos;s because the investment isn &apos;t so clear , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world looking
the fact is that the uncertainty should worry about us .
&quot; but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the carbon , the skeptics say , &quot; &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t care that it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s the fact , but i &apos;m probably accepting it
ca : and that would be your answer to the bjorn lomborg argument , that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals below underneath , the poverty of malaria , and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest
bg : well , the actual spending for research--let &apos;s say the u. s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today--that &apos;s not so dramatic .
there shouldn &apos;t be other things about it .
you get too big money , and here you can resist reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to fund that. for me , most of us , most waste is happening .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short before a free breakthrough , and it &apos;s only the learning system , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much more cheaper .
if you get the treaty that you get , it &apos;s a very high energy price , it &apos;s just the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
&quot; his new masche is now , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t research anymore ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he &apos;s still going to associate because of his former stories , with the skeptic camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so now he &apos;s now making the research .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , just how little that &apos;s supported .
ca : bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost everybody here if i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true. thank you so much .
bg : thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i &apos;d like to do with a couple of months ago when i write a paper for italian wired .
&quot; i &apos;ve always write my synonym @-@ dictionaries , but i &apos;ve been done with the bearh of the textes , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never done in my life , which really means &quot; &quot; disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i read the talk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; disabled , &quot; &quot; helpless , helpless , useful , disgusted , declining , declining , declining , tears , paralyzed , paralyzed , impotent , impotent , paralyzed , paralyzed senil , paralyzed ,
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful .
&quot; i read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh it so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; &quot; approach , &quot; &quot; and i couldn &apos;t go anymore , and i had to stop reading , and i &apos;m just collecting , and i &apos;m collecting
of course , this was an amazing , oldest synonym @-@ dictionaries , and i just thought that the task needs to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a task on the early &apos; 80s , when i was starting to start with the elementary school , and i started building my self @-@ image outside of my family environment and shape , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use synonym @-@ dictionaries at that time .
if i were to take this talk seriously , i was born in a world that would have a person like me as a person whose life can &apos;t be positive , but today i &apos;m going to go to the chance and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately got up to the online issue of 2009 , and expect me to find out here .
here &apos;s the actualized version of this talk .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
&quot; in particular , the last two words under &quot; &quot; near antonyms &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; healthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that stick in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of aging societies , including the greeks and the rome , have really believed that the conversation of a river has a big force , because what you can manifest out of it is also manifest .
so what do we actually want to manifest--a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just to pay attention to a human being eightless than a kid could be able to convey them , and to give them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them ?
a person who opened door for me was my children &apos;s a. i. dupont institut in wil toma in delaware .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo. it &apos;s a italo american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t get correct. so he &apos;s called dr. p .
and dr. p. wore very bunons of flies and was simply working with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great--up to my physiotherapy .
i had to be infinitely remarkably often with these thick , elastic banders--in different colors--you know , to build my leg muscle , and i &apos;ve heard more than anything else. i hated them. i hated them. i hated them .
and imagine i &apos;ve been negotiating as five @-@ year @-@ old kid with dr. p. and so trying to stop these exercises without success .
&quot; and one day he watched me with one of my exercises--these exercises were just flooded and gnadenless--and he said to me , &quot; &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to break one day one of
&quot; and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was , of course , a simple trick of dr. p. so i do make the exercises i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that richest five @-@ year @-@ old girls in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it
and i wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl , my self @-@ imagery , and i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature , powerful and breathing human beings .
this is just an example of many , as adults in power records can expect the imagination of a child .
but like the already quote examples of the synonym @-@ dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t have a room to imagine what we all wanted to know : to allow every single one to see themselves as powerful people .
our language goes back to the social changes that have gone through a technological change .
now , of course , from medical view , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for sehbe , mirrors from titan and artificial hats for aging bodies that allow people to really use all of their possibilities and develop beyond the borders that you have , not to talk about social networking
and with that , in the world , it &apos;s increasing groups that they &apos;re exploring themselves .
so perhaps this technological change is clear because ever that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being of society can give a very special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus .
now , the human ability to adapt--this is an interesting story , because people ask me to tell me about how to deal with widrigkeits and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never missed for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with answering the questions
so this sentence of widrigkeits live by the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being collected by being connected experience , as if my life would be so successful because i could make the possible of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people think of me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change ourselves. of course we &apos;re wearing from the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
widrigkeits are not obstacle that we need to be more comfortable to get better with our lives .
widrigkeits just belong to our lives .
and i tend to see widrigkeits as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very presentation , sometimes he &apos;s hard to see , but it &apos;s all about me .
and i don &apos;t want to put the impact on it , and the heavy of the fight of a human being .
there are widrigkeits and challenges , and they &apos;re only all the same real and every person is about to deal with widrigkeits or not , but the question is not whether we &apos;re getting clear or not , but how we get clear .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love before destiny , but they &apos;re also willing to prepare well with it .
and we don &apos;t tell our children if we give them the sense that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to understand two things : one of the health cares to be amputing and to others the social opinion about whether i &apos;m behindzed or not .
and to be honest , the only real and staying disability that i had to set up with is that the world is constantly saying , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are on heart and fill them the cold , hard truth about their medicines , or even a forecast for life that they expect , we have to admit that we don &apos;t have to put the property that somebody &apos;s actually disagree .
maybe the moment concept that only minds about what &apos;s broken , and how we fix it , for every single one of them , a bigger disability than the pathology .
if we &apos;re not treating a human being , and we &apos;re not going to perceive all of his forces and possibilities , we &apos;re creating in addition to the natural fight you might have to lead another disease .
we degrade a person who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
but most importantly , there &apos;s between the perception of our impossibility and our great inventor , there &apos;s a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t have these challenges of times , we shouldn &apos;t try and avoid them , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , but we should be able to see them underneath the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing in the willingness .
it might be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t need to overcome widrigkeits , but that we &apos;re open to humility , to humility , to put them on the creation , to use a struggle , and perhaps to dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re creating widrigkeits than something natural , right and useful and useful , and we don &apos;t feel so stressed through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in human nature .
i would write it like this : not the most strongest of its kind , and also not the smartest of its way , but the one who can adjust change best .
conflict comes from creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people to survive and to survive , is determined by the struggle of human mind to change through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans .
and maybe we know about what wood we &apos;re carrying when we &apos;re really checking .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of widrigkeits , a perception of me , is a sense of our own power .
we can do something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see widrigkeits as change .
widrigkeits are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage we have to feel ourselves is that we should be normal .
even honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual. the typical , but not the normal , and would you really want to know that poor , gray person , if they really wanted to know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be great if we could have this paradigm of normality against another of possibilities or stronger , to even engage it a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many children , and to put them in a very special and valuable skills in society .
anthropolls have found that we have always taken people from the members of our society : to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have been about 60 , 000 years ago , older people and people with heavy physical injuries , and maybe that &apos;s because the life experience of these people were valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useful ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up , in a food market in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there before a nice tomato .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
&quot; and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man. i had no idea who he is .
&quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , you couldn &apos;t remember me . &quot;
&quot; when i saw her for the first time , i got her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it made clicks .
this was dr. kean , a man that i knew from telling my mom about this day , because of course , i became a typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for pranatale diagnostic my mother was in vacation , so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet had been born after them , and i only had some toes on this , and a few toes at the other , he was the overbringing , this stranger had to kill the bad news .
&quot; and he said to me , &quot; &quot; i had to say your parents you &apos;d never walked , and you &apos;d never have to be astonishing as other kids or that you could never lead an independent life , and they &apos;ve just been just thought of me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , i found that he collected newspapers of my entire childhood , whether i had won with a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was in the pfadfinders at the parade to halloween , whether i had my scholarship or one of my sport sieges , and he used this clip to
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
&quot; and dr. kean went on , he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get something else , and even if they get a little support , when you &apos;re overestimated kids , children can achieve a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deal with that are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time when they asked me about 15 years old , whether i &apos;d been shattered my prosthetics against meat and bone , i didn &apos;t have a second .
i really wanted to get normal at that time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not yet this experience .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;m so many people who opened me door instead of looking at people who wanted to constraints me or want to translate an idea .
you see , it really takes just a human demonstizing them how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you enable someone to activate its own internal forces , the human mind is so embarrassing--if you do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they teach them to open yourself .
&quot; the real meaning of the word &quot; &quot; educate &quot; &quot; worm in the word &quot; &quot; educate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to produce something that in one is the potential of it .
again , what potential do we want to call it ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u. k . , a paradigm was done in the u. k . , and then gymnasies were released in total schools .
&quot; they call this &quot; &quot; streaming trials &quot; &quot; in the u. s. we call this as &quot; &quot; tracking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
students are going to be made by notes .
and the a student is getting more harder , getting better teachers and so on .
&quot; they then have given a three @-@ month period of time with a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; note &quot; &quot; very well , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; they &apos;d be very smart , and they &apos;d be written for those three months . &quot;
and of course , it &apos;s to hear you hear the heart that reverses the lone students , they &apos;re only sufficient .
and then it was just after three months .
but only those who were still in school--except for the students who had missing school .
it was very crucial about this study that the teachers weren &apos;t used .
the teacher didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they &apos;re the one @-@ student student , and that are the students with the note , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;ve been treated .
the only really disability is a mind that has been broken , has no hope more. he doesn &apos;t find anything more. he lacks our natural , child curiosity , and our innovators of imagination .
but if we create it to support the human minds , continue to continue to hope and find themselves and other people around it , to be curious and honesty , we actually put our forces really positive .
if a mind prevents about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new movement .
&quot; i want to end with a poem that was verfasstd by a persian poet named hafiz at 14 . &quot; &quot; and i told my friend jacques of thebois , and the poem is called &quot; &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god of the name , not the god who
come on , dance with me. thank you .
