" a few years ago here at ted, peter skillman asked a design competition called" " the marshmallow challenge. " " "
the idea is quite simple. four-teams need to have the largest freeest structure with 20 spaghetti, about 1, 000 tape, ca. 1m faden and a marshmallow.
marshmallow has to be up there.
and, even though it's really easy, it's really hard, because people's wired very quickly.
and so i thought this is an interesting idea, and i turned it into a design workshop.
it was a huge success.
since then, i've done about 70 workshops around the world, with students, unleashed and architects, even with ctos of fortune 50 companies, and there's something about this task, which enables deep impression into nature of collaboration, and i want to share some of them with them.
usually most people start orient to the task.
you talk about it, you think it's going to look like it's going to look like power.
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization, and they skied and they put spaghetti.
they invest most of their time in the context of growing structures.
" and finally, before you don't have any time, somebody takes the marshmallow, and you put it on top of the top, and you go back and go, " " ta-da! admire your work. "
" but then, what happens, almost always, is that the" " ta-da" " is going to be a" " uh-oh, because the weight of marshmallol is confusing that the whole thing is verbing and stops. "
there's a number of people who have much more uh oh moments than others, and under the worst are fresh bwl.
they lie, they're using, they're confused, they're truly confusing.
" and of course, teams have the much more" " ta-da, " " and among the best ones are peacekeepers of the kindergarten. "
and that's pretty amazing.
as peter told us peter, not just the highest tower, but also the most interesting structures of all.
what you might be wondering: how is this? why? what about those?
" and peter said, " " no kids invested time in the spaghetti gmbh. " " "
they don't invest time in power.
but there's another reason.
and that bwl students were trained to find the right plan, ok!
and then realizing him.
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top, you don't have time anymore and what happens?
it's a crisis.
sounds familiar, what?
what kindergarten kids do differently is they start building marshmallow and building prototypes, always with marshmallow at the top, so that they've got the opportunity to fix the building.
construction programs recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of an incredible process.
and with each attempt, kids get immediate feedback what works and what doesn' t.
so the performance is to work with prototypes, basically--but let's see how different teams does.
the average for most is about 50cm, bwl students create half of them, lawyers are more, but not much, kindergarten children are better than adults.
who's most successful?
architects and engineers, happiness.
one is the highest thing i've seen.
and why? because they understand triangles and themselves-distance geometry are the key to build stable structures.
ceos is about average, but here it's going to be interesting.
if you put a exekutive administrator on the team, you're going to become more significant.
" it's incredible. you see around and see, " " this team will win. " " "
you can predict that. why is that?
because they have special skills of the process.
they take the process, they understand him.
and that's the team that's set up, and the work goes to work is going to improve the performance of the teams.
specialists and processes and their combinations and their combinations.
if you have 10 teams that's going to make typical, you've got about six that have stable structures.
now, i tried something exciting.
i thought we're going to get the signature.
so i'm a piece of$ prize in software for the profit.
what do you think happened to these design students?
what was the result?
this happened. not a team had a stable structure.
if anybody had built a 2.5-inch construction construction, he was wearing the price home.
so isn't it interesting that high competition have a strong effect?
we repeated this exercise with the same students.
what do you think happened?
now, understand the benefit of the prototyping.
so from the same, bad team of one under the best.
they made the highest construction in the least time.
so there's so profound lessons for us, about the natural and success.
you may ask: why would anyone invest a marshmallow challenge?
the reason is, i'm helping digital tools and processes to help teams, cars, video games and visual effects.
and what the marshmallow challenge does is to identify them hidden assumptions.
because frankly, each project has its own marshmallow.
the challenge offers a common experience, a shared language, or a conversation to build the right prototype.
and this is the value of this experience, this simple exercise.
and those of you who care about it can go to marshmallowchge. com visit.
it's a blog where you see how to build marshmallows.
there's a step-for-step show there.
you find crazy examples from all over the world, like people optimize the system.
there's also world record as well.
and the basale lesson, i think, is actually a connective sport.
it requires that we all represent our senses to the task, and that we use our thinking optimal, like our emotions and ourselves, in the challenge that we have.
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that it takes us from a uh-oh moment to a ta-da moment.
and that can make a big difference.
thank you.
do we as if we had a machine here.
a big machine, a cool, ted-like machine, and that's a time machine.
and everybody in this room has to go in.
and you can go to the past, you can go to the future; you can't stay here and now.
and i wonder what you'd choose because i asked my friends in the last time, and they all wanted to go to the past.
" i don't know. they wanted to go back before there were cars or twitter or" " america's search for the superstar. " " "
i don't know.
i'm convinced that you're sort of going to the nostalgia, you're going to be able to think about.
and that's what i understand.
i'm not part of this group, i have to say.
i don't want to go to the past, and that's not because i'm a adventure.
it's because possibilities on this planet don't go back, they're going forward.
so i want to go into this machine, and i want to go to the future.
this is the great time ever in the planet anywhere else, no matter what scales they're empowering: health, wealth, mobility, opportunities, sinkende disease rates.
there was never been a time before.
my great grandparents died as they were 60.
my grandparents are the number of 70.
my parents are the 80 on the tv.
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my death.
but it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger thing than that.
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago.
think about it. this is an incredible fact.
and why is that?
smallpox. smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet.
they reinforce the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done.
they're gone. they're gone.
we set them up. puff.
in the rich world, disease exist, millions of us have only threatened only one generation yet.
diphterie, reds, children' slahmung. . .
anyone know what that is?
vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are success of scientific methods.
and from my view, the scientific method is to try to look at things, see if it works, if it doesn' t, one of the greatest achievements of humanity.
so that's the good news.
unfortunately, that's the whole good news, because there's some other problems, and they're often mentioned.
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements, there's a billion people around the world to go hungry every day.
this number goes up, and it's increasing very quickly, and that's swallow.
and not only that, we've used our imagination to admire this world.
drinking water, great land, rainforests, oil, gas: they disappear, and if we don't get out of this chaos--innovators we disappear.
so the question is: can we do that? i think.
i think it's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without rape the country where they live on.
i think we can feed this world with energy that doesn't destroy them at the same time.
i really think that, and no, that's not a wish.
but this is what i think night--one of the things that hold me at night, we've never really needed scientific progress as well as now.
and we've never been able to make it reasonable, as we can now.
we're at the threshold of an amazing, amazing event on many areas, and yet, i really think we had to go back hundreds and 300 years ago to go back to find a time where we've got progress, where we've been given about these things more than now.
people are in their faith, and that's how they can't liberate them.
not even the truth will liberate it.
and listen, everybody's got a right on his mind; even a right on its opinion.
but do you know where do you don't have a right?
you don't have a right on your own facts. 't sweeping, you don' t.
and i needed a while to find that.
about a decade ago, i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker, a little article.
and i was amazed to resist on resistance, on resistance to what's the most effective measure in health care in human history.
i didn't know what to do, so i just did what i do, i wrote an article and i went on.
and soon after that, i wrote an article about gentechnual food.
the same thing, just bigger.
people played crazy.
" so i've written a paper about this, and i couldn't understand why people thought, " " frankenfood, " " why they thought that molecules were going to be a random way around a random way of random. "
but you know, i do what i do. i wrote the article, i went on.
i mean, i'm a journalist.
we type, we rich, we eat, that's okay.
but this article made me worried about why, and i couldn't find out why, and eventually i found it out.
and that's because these fanatics that made me even crazy at all.
these were invisible people, educated people, educated people.
they were just like the people in this room.
and that got me through that way. . .
but then i thought, you know what, let's be honest.
we're at a point where we don't have the same relationship to progress.
we talk about it.
" we're talking ironic of it with small leaders: " " progress. " " "
okay, there's reasons for that, and i think we know what the reasons are.
we have lost the confidence in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science, and there's no reason why that shouldn't be that way.
you can just call a couple of names, and people will understand.
tschernobyl, bhopal, the challenger, vioxx, mass destruction, the u. s. presidentswahl 2000.
i mean, you know, you can choose your own list.
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they had always right. so, be skeptical.
ask questions, desire they're evidence, desire to be evidence.
don't take anything for granted.
but now, if you get evidence, you have to assume that evidence, and we're not good at it.
and i can say that we're now living in a epidemic of fear, as i've never seen it, and hopefully we'll never see again.
about 12 years ago, a story published, a terrible story that brought the autism epidemic with the masern, brave, and red vaccines in connection.
very fearful.
well, researchers have been done to see if that's true.
" " " researchers should be done, " " that's a serious issue. "
the data came in.
the data came from the united states, from england, from sweden, from canada, and they were all equal, no correlation, no connection, no connection.
it doesn't make a difference. it doesn't make any difference, because we believe in anecdotes, we believe what we see, what we think we're really feeling.
we don't believe in a bunch of documents that gives us data, and i understand that, i think we all do.
but you know what?
the result of that was catastrophic.
catastrophic because of this fact: the u. s. is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine sins for masern.
this is scandalos, and we should be ashamed.
it's awful.
what's happening is we could do that.
well, i understand that. i do.
because did anybody here?
does one in the audience have ever seen anybody dying?
it doesn't happen very often.
it's not happening in this country, but 160, 000 times in the world last year.
these are many deaths through masern, 20 an hour.
but because this isn't happening here, we can hurt it, and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and predict messages from fear and analphabetism like oprah and larry king live.
and they can do that because they don't connect and correlate.
they don't understand that these things seem to be the same, but almost never are the same.
and that's something we need to learn, and that's very fast.
this guy was a hero, jonas salk.
he's liberating us from one of the worst awarenesss of humanity.
no fears, children' slahmung, puff, disappeared.
the guy in the middle is not so much.
he's called paul offit.
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people.
he can save the lives of 400, 500, 000 children a year in the developing world.
pretty good, isn't it?
well, that's good, except that paul goes around and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are, and that people should stop jamhs.
and he actually says that.
so paul is a terrorist.
if paul speaks to a public bakery, he can't make up without armed whales.
he's getting calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school.
and why? because paul did a vaccine.
i don't need to say that, but vaccines are infinity.
you take it back, you go back the disease, terrible diseases, and that's happening.
we have masern in this country now.
and that's worse, and pretty soon kids will die again, because that's just a question of numbers.
and they're not just dying of masern.
what about kids do? do we take that. why not?
a commiliated of mine written me a few weeks ago, and she said i'm a little too swim.
no one ever said that before.
she wouldn't be immunized their children against children. no case.
fine.
why? because we don't have children's flu, and you know what?
we didn't have children yesterday in this country yesterday.
today, i don't know, maybe someone in lagos tomorrow in a plane today, and it's just going to go to los angeles right now, right now.
and in a few hours, he landed and mietet a car, and he comes to long beach, and he's going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight.
and he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralyzed disease, and we don't know, because that's how the world works.
this is the planet we live on. don't do it as if it's not.
we love ourselves. we love that.
do you have all your vitamins today?
echinacea, a little bit of antioxidantium that helps you go to the jump.
i know you've done that because half of americans make it every day.
they take the stuff, and they take alternative cure, and it doesn't make a difference how often we figure out they're useful.
and the data is all the time.
they lose their urine. they almost never do.
that's okay, you'd like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine.
i'm totally wrong with you.
dark urine. dark.
why do we do that? why do we do that?
well, i think i understand--we hate the pharmaceutical industry.
we hate one too strong government. we don't have a system trust.
and we shouldn' t. our healthcare system is mies.
it's cruel to millions of people.
it's absolutely amazing to us and sealentotend self that can afford it.
so we're walking away, and where are we going?
we're walking into the poor of the placebo industry.
that's great. i love the placebo industry.
but you know, that's really a serious issue, because the stuff is mix, and we spend billions of dollars for that.
and i have all kinds of little requisite here.
no one of them--gingko, cheat, cheetahs, acai, i don't even know what that is, but we spend billions of dollars for it, it's cheaper.
" and you know what? when i say that, i write people and say, " " what do you care? let's do what you want. "
" that's how you feel good. " " "
and you know what? you have injustice.
" because it doesn't matter whether it's healthcare, which says, " " hmm, i won't assume the evidence of my experts to mammography, " " or any cancer quacksalber who wants to treat his patients with coffee. "
if you give up this way where belief and magic and science, you get to a place where you don't want to be.
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa.
he took 400, 000 of his people, because he insisted that red started, knoblauch and quotes are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can brake aids.
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is worse than any other of these disease.
don't tell me that these things don't have consequences.
they have them. they always have them.
now, the brain-oses epidemic that we're in right now is this absurd battle between the answers of economic economic food and the bio elite.
this is a idiotic debate. you have to stop.
it's a debate about words, over metaphors.
this is ideology, not science.
everything we eat, every rice, every branch of petersilie, every rosenkohl, was changed by people.
you know, there were no mandarins in paradise.
there was no eye-loupe melones. there was no christmas trees. we did it all.
we did it in the last 11, 000 years.
and some of them worked and some of them don' t.
we're deleting what doesn't work.
now we can do it precisely, and of course there are risks, but we can do something like vitamin a in rice, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, their lives.
you don't want to do that?
i have to say that i don't understand.
we're going to live in the same way that we're going to change food.
why do we do that?
now, what i'm constantly hearing is too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don't want to have huge fields with one thing, that's wrong.
we don't want companies to patent.
we don't want companies to have seeds.
and you know what my answer is all this?
yeah, they're right. let's see that.
it's true, we have a huge food problem, but that's not science.
that has nothing to do with science.
it's right, moral, patentkram.
you know that science is not a company.
it's not a country.
it's not even an idea; it's a process.
it's a process, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't work, but the idea that we shouldn't allow science to do their work, because we're afraid of a real thing, and it's about millions of people from the islands.
you know, in the next 50 years, we're going to have to build 70 percent more food than at the moment. 70 percent.
this investment in africa in the last 30 years.
gentlemen. shave.
they need that, and we don't give them it.
and why? svaly changed food.
we don't want to encourage people to eat this eradication stuff like maniok.
maniok is something that eat half a billion people.
it's about a potatoes.
it's just a bunch of calories. it's mies.
it has no nutrients, it doesn't have a protein, and scientists are building all this in it.
and then people could eat that and wouldn't be blind.
you wouldn't starve, and you know what?
that would be nice. it wouldn't be chez panisse, but it would be nice.
and all i can say is: why do we fight that?
i mean, we ask ourselves, why do we fight that?
because we don't want to shoot genes around?
it's not about moving genes around. it's not about chemicals.
it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insights on greater food, better food, unique food.
it's not about rice krispies, it's about getting people alive, and it's going to be time to understand what that means.
because you know what?
if we don't do that, if we keep doing that as far as we're doing something guilty that we, i think, don't want to be guilty, high-tech colonialism.
there's no other description for what's happening here.
it's selfish, it's ugly, it's not worthy, and we really have to stop that.
" so after that incredibly funny conversation, you might want to say, " " do you want to go to this ridiculous time machine and go into the future? " " "
anyway. that's what i want to do.
right now, it's in the present, but we have an incredible possibility.
we can put this time machine on everything we want.
we can move it down where we want it, and we're going to move them where we want.
we need to lead these conversations, and we need to think, but if we go into the time engine, and in the future, we're going to be happy to have that.
i know we can, and as far as it turns me, that's what the world needs now.
thank you. thank you.
when steve lopez, columnist of los angeles times, one day went through the streets of los angeles, he heard a wonderful music.
she came from a man, an african american, sympathy, rau, homeless, who played on a violin that had two strings.
many of you will know the story, because from steves article about this later, a book that was filmed with robert downey junior than steve lopez and jamie foxx as a nathaniel anthony ayers, the contrabassisten, who studied on juilliard
nathaniel left juilliard, rolled up a nerveal breakthrough, and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles.
i'm going to recommend all of you to read the book or look at the film so that they're not just understanding the wonderful connectedness between these two men, but also how the music helped this connection, and how she finally became the instrument when this word is allowed to get the nat
i met mr ayers in 2008, two years ago, in the walt disney concert hall.
he'd just heard about beethoven's first and fourth sinfonie, and came behind the stage to imagine.
he spoke in a very high and social sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton, and about how dodgers never would make it into the baseball world series, and all because of the tuckic passage of the first step in the last sentence of beethoven's fourth sinfonie.
we came to talk about music, and a couple of days later, i got a email in which i got nathaniel was interested in me.
i have to mention that nathaniel has been able to make a medical treatment, because he had already been treated with electricalchocks and thorazin and handschell, a trauma that has been tracking his whole life.
now, as a consequence of that, he's particularly random for these schizophrenan phasen, and they're so bad that they're drowning it and they're walking around the streets of skid row, always exposed to this horror and torture of his own mind.
and in just such a richer, nathaniel, when we started with our first class of education in the walt disney concert hall, he'd lost this irre flackern in his eyes.
he talked about invisible dams and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison in sleep.
i was scared, not myself, but i was afraid that i could lose him, that he could assure him in one of his states, and that i could destroy him his relationship to him when i started talking about tons and arpeggios and other exciting shapes of the didaktic
so i started playing.
i played the first sentence of beethoven's violin concert.
and while i was playing, i noticed that in nathaniel's eyes, a completely change.
it was like he stood under the impact of an invisible drug, a chemical response whose catalyst was my game.
nathaniel manic anger turned into understanding, in a quiet curiosity and grace.
and like a miracle he took his violin, and he began to play some clips of violin companies and then asked me to end them: mendelssohn, tschaikowski, sibelius.
we started talking about music, starting from trees about beethoven, brahms, bridge and all the other bs, from bartok to the train station.
and i realized that he had not only had an encyclopedia about music, but also with her a tightly personal relationship with it.
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding i've only heard of my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles.
by talking about music, talking about music, was made of this paranoid, confused man who was still moved through the streets of los angeles, a loving, educated, excellent, in juilliard ausgebildeter musicians.
music is medicine. music changes us.
for nathaniel, music soul is health.
because the music allowed him to introduce his thoughts and walls with help of his imagination and creativity into something real.
and so he's going to unleashed his distraction.
i understood that that's the nature of art.
and that's the reason why we make music: so we do something that has all of us, deep inside, our feelings, through our artistic lens, through our creativity for reality.
and the reality of that expression is all of us, and move, inspired us.
what nathaniel anging, so the music brought him back to a community of friends.
the power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who realized him he recognized his talent and started it.
and i'm going to keep with nathaniel musi, whether in the walt disney concert hall or in skid row, because he reminds me why i've become musicians.
thank you.
bruno giussani: thank you. thank you.
robert gupta.
robert gupta: i want to play something i've stolen the cellist.
i hope you disturbing me.
i am jane mcgonigal. i design computer games.
i've been doing online games for 10 years now, and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality, how to save online games.
i have a plan for that. i want to convince more people, including all of you, spend more time with play bigger and great games.
now, we spend three billion hours a week with online games.
" some of you might think, " " that's a lot of time for games. " " "
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
but actually, my research at the institute of the future, is the opposite.
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world.
in fact, i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we have to increase that time.
i've calculated that the time needs at 21 billion hours a week.
now, this seems to be a little bit wrong, so i repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts and obesity, i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week.
playing to the end of the next decade. no, i really mean it seriously.
why? this image describes pretty much.
why i believe that games are so unexpected for the survival of human species in the future. seriously.
this is a photographer's photographer phil toledano ride.
he wanted to start the feelings playing, so he built a camera in front of the player.
this is one of the classic expression in play.
if you're not a player, some of the nuances in this picture.
you're probably going to see this sense of urgency, something scared, but also extremely concentration, in a really difficult problem.
if you're playing, you're going to see some nuances here, and the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows are surprised.
this is a player who's standing on the edge of an epic siege.
oh, you know that. ok. prima.
so we have some player here.
a epic victory is a result that is so positive that they didn't even know that it was possible at all.
it was almost beyond imagination. and if they reach it, they're shocked.
that they're actually capable of able to do that. this is a epic.
this player is about a epic victory.
and this is what we've got to see on millions of problems around the world, when we're taking the hurdles of the next century, the face of the facialness of all the widrigkeits on the edge of a epic siege.
well, unfortunately, we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems.
" i call it the" " in life i'm bad. " " "
and it's actually my face, you see? yeah? ok.
" that's me, how i do that" " in life i am bad. " " "
this is a graffiti in my former home home in berkeley, california, where i studied in my ph. d. why we're in play better than we are in real life.
this is a problem that many players have.
we think that in reality, we're not as good at play.
and i don't mean less successful, even though it's heard.
we reach more in games.
i mean good at the relationship with motivation to do something meaningful, inspired each other.
if we're in a game world, i think many of us are turning into our best version, every time and instantly, hardnackig are trying to solve the problem as long as necessary, trying to try it again.
and in reality, if we fail, if we put it on obstacles, we often feel differently.
we feel overwhelmed. we feel threatened. we feel threatened, maybe depressed, frustrated or frustrated.
these feelings we never have when we play games, they don't have them.
and that's what i wanted to study as a graduate student.
why is it impossible to think, you couldn't just reach anything?
how can we translate these feelings from play into reality?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft, which offers the ideal environment for the community problem.
and i discovered some things that are going to make the epic siege in online worlds.
so first, if you go to one of these online games, especially with world of warcraft, there's a lot of different characters that are willing to convert you to a planet mission immediately.
but not just any mission, but a mission that fit perfectly in your current level, right?
so they do that.
you never get a job you can't solve.
but always at the edge of your skills, so you have to deal with.
but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft, and you're not sitting around and you're talking about it, and there's always a little bit important to do something important.
and there's a bunch of employees.
wherever they go, hundreds of thousands of people working with them to join their epic mission.
we don't have that easy in the real life, that feeling that at a fingertiped fingertips are willing to be ready.
and also, there's this epic story, this inspiring story, why we're there and what we're doing, we're going to get this whole positive feedback.
" you've heard of" " level high" " and" " +1 stronger" " or" " +1. intelligence. " " "
this constant feedback is not in the real life.
if i'm going to leave that stage, i don't talk about+1, and+1 crazy idea, +20 crazy idea.
i don't get that feedback during the real life.
so, the problem of cooperation online worlds like world of warcraft is that it's so comfortable to stand at the edge of a epic siege, that we're trying to spend our entire time in these games.
they're just better than reality.
until now, all world of warcraft players have spent five and 93 million years together to solve the virtual problems of azeroth.
that's not necessarily something bad.
it might sound ubel.
but to see it in context: five and 93 million years ago, our first primates began to go upright.
so the first owner of primate.
okay, so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play, it makes sense when you think about the time in terms of human development, which is extraordinary.
but also, because it turns out that by using all this time, we're going to play this whole time, actually change what we're capable of as humans.
we develop ourselves too common thinking, heart failure.
that's the truth. i believe it.
now, look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university: the average young man today in a country today is using 10, 000 hours of online games to the 21st of life.
so 10, 000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons.
first of all, for kids in the united states, 10, twenty hours are the exact total time that they spend in school from five grade to high school--if you never lack. so here we have a complete one.
parallel training, the young people are learning exactly what it means to be a good player, like anything else they learn in school.
" and maybe some of you read the new book of malcolm gladwell, " " overflieger, " " so you know your theory of success, the theory of success of success. "
it's based on the great science of cognitive science that, if we spend 10, 000 hours to the trash of a subject to the 21st of life, we're going to master to it.
we're going to be so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world.
so what we have here is a completely generation of young people who are mastery player.
" so the big question is, " " what are players mastery good? " " "
because if we could figure that out, we'd never have before before available human potential.
so many people we have currently in the world that spend at least an hour a day with online games.
these are our mastery player, 500 million people who are extraordinary in something.
and in the next decade, we have another billion player that are extraordinary in whatever.
if you haven't heard it yet.
the game industry developed concepts that save energy and work on mobile networks instead of the broadband internet so that players around the world, especially in india, china, brazil online.
you expect a additional billion player in the next decade.
so we've got 1.5 billion player.
so i started thinking about what it is, what it is to make us make these games.
here are the four things i found. first of all, dringlichkeits optimism.
ok, imagine this as extreme self-potential.
dringlichkeits optimism is the desire to do something immediately, to master hurdles, with the belief that we have a underlying hope on success.
players always believe that a epic is possible, and that it's always worthwhile to try and try and do it.
players don't sit around.
players are mastery in the spider poets of social nets.
there's a lot of interesting studies that show that we like more after we've played with them, even if they've dropped us.
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game.
we trust that somebody else with us, that the rules are going to be raised, that we've got the same goal, and we've got to play with it.
so this enables together to grow and trust and each other.
as a result, we build stronger social relationships.
happiness. fantastic!
you know, there's a reason why the average word of warcraft play 22 hours a week, as a part-time job.
the reason is that if we play, we're actually happier to work hard than we're relaxing or do nothing.
we know that as human beings, we work optimal when we're doing hard, important work.
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task.
and finally, epische meaning.
player love to become part of the most honest science of the world.
here's a background information to spin the right light, and you know all wikipedia, the largest wiki of the world.
the second largest wiki in the world with nearly 80, 000 entries is the world of warcraft wiki.
five million people use it every month.
they made more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other issue in every other wiki in the world.
they create a epic story.
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft.
ok, so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome, and players are super-powerful, hopeful individuals.
it's people who think they can change the world as individuals.
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds, but not the real problem.
that's the problem i'm trying to solve.
edward castronova is a people scientist.
his work is brilliant. he studied why.
people spend so much time, energy and money in online worlds.
" and he says, " " we're not going to be less than a mass journal in virtual worlds and online games. " " "
and that's from an economist. so it's logically.
and he says. . . not just like me. . . i'm a little bit of play, i'm a little bit pregnant.
so he says that actually makes sense, because players in online worlds can achieve more than in real life.
you can knit stronger social attributes than real life, you get more feedback and reward in games than real life.
so, he says it's totally logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world.
i just agree, that's logical.
but it's definitely not a optimal debate.
we need to start turning the real world into a game.
my inspiration comes from an event to go back 2, 500 years.
there's this ancient cube, from sheep cracks. you know?
before these fantastic toys, there were schafsknochels.
and these were the first of people developed toys, and if you're familiar with the idea of the ancient greek historian herodotus, you might know this story. the story about how and why games were invented.
according to herodotus, games were invented, in the kingdom of lydien, during the famine.
there was such a big famine that the king of lydien determined to a crazy idea.
people were fighting. people fought.
it was a extreme situation. you needed a extreme solution.
so they invented, according to herodotus, the root game and simplify a national strategy. one day you would eat. the next day you would play.
and they would be so intriguing in the root game, because games are so intriguing and surrounded us with happiness, happiness productivity, that they were forget that there was nothing to eat.
and then the next day you would play. and the next day you would eat.
and according to herodotus, they survived this famine for 18 years by playing it on a day and the next one.
just as i think we're playing games today.
we put games in order to escape the suffering of the real world, and we play games to make everything that doesn't work in the real world, especially that in real life, and we're going to get what we need from play.
but that doesn't have to be the end.
that's the exciting.
according to herodotus, after 18 years, the famine wouldn't be better, so the king decided to create a last root game.
they shared the kingdom in two.
they played a root game, and the seals were allowed to break up to a epic adventure.
they left lydien and they were looking for the search for a new home, and they just pulled back as many people to survive, and they were looking for the rest of the rest they could live in.
that sounds crazy, right?
but newest dna evidence show that the etrusker, which later the rome rich, the same dna as the old lydier.
so scientists recently came to address that herodotus's crazy story actually.
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain the famine.
so this crazy story could vote.
maybe they've saved their people through play by dying for 18 years and then had this environment and learned so much about each other, that they saved all the civilization.
so we can.
we've been playing for 1994 warcraft since 1994.
this was the first one in real time.
the world of warcraft series. this was 16 years ago.
they played worms for 18 years, we've been playing warcraft for 16 years.
i'm saying we're ready for our own episches game.
so, they sent half of their civilization search for a new world, so i'll take my 21 billion play hours a week.
we should prepare that half of us spend an hour a day, until we solve the problems of real world.
" i know you're going to ask, " " how do we solve problems of real world. "
" in play? " " and that's exactly what i've been thinking about for the last few years of the future. "
we have this banner in our office in palo alto, it pushs how to understand the future.
we don't want to try to predict the future before.
what we want is to create the future.
we want to imagine the best possible outcome, and then people to empower this idea into reality.
we imagine epic siege, and we give people the possibilities to reach them.
i'm going to show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try and try to make people epic siege in their own future.
" this is" " world without oil. " " "
the game is 2007.
it's a online game where you've got to overcome a oil.
the oil is invented, but we've got enough online content so it's going to be realistic for them, and they're actually living their real life without oil, so if you're going to go to the game, tell us where you live, and then you get news movies in real time
how transportation is being closed, whether schools are closed, and they have to figure out how to make their real life when it's true, and we ask them to blogging about it, videos or photos.
we tested this game with 1, 700 players in 2007, and we've been tested it over the last three years.
and i can tell you, it was a changing experience.
nobody wants to change his life because it's good for the environment or because we should.
" but if you're in a epic adventure, and you'll say, " " we'll go out of oil. " " "
this is a fascinating adventure you're going to go on.
find out how they were going to survive, most of our players have learned in the game.
so for the next worlds, we've created a greater, higher goal than just oil.
we developed the game superstruct institute for the future.
in fact, the calculation of a supercomputers is that people have only left 23 years on the planet left.
" this supercomputer is called" " global sensitivity sensitivity system, " " of course. "
the call to play, we've designed almost like a jerry bridge film.
you know, jerry bruckheimer movies, where there's the dream team. you have the astronauts, the scientist, the ex-punishment, and you can save them together.
but in our game, instead of just five people, we say, everybody is in dream team, and it's our job to create energy, food, health, safety and the future of social justice.
8, 000 players were playing the game for eight weeks.
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google superstruct.
and the last game we bring out on the 3. march. it's a game in collaboration with the world bank.
" if you finish the game, you get the record from the world bank, " " social transcripts, " " abschluss 2010. "
we're working with universities in all black africa, and we're using them to learn social transmitted.
we have a comic to do it. we have a level high for regionales, wissensvernetzung, sustainability, vision and ingenuity.
i want to put them all together to share this game with young people all over the world, especially in development objects that benefit together to imagine their own social practices to save the world.
i'll come to the end.
i want to ask you something.
what do you think happens next?
we have all these fantastic players, we have games that show us what we can do, but we haven't rescued the real world yet.
well, i hope that they agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in real life, and that games have a big meaning for change.
we have all these superpowers, happiness productivity, the ability to make tight social networks, dringlichkeits optimism and the desire for epi scientists.
i really hope that we're playing with significant games to survive another century.
and i hope you'll design with me and play with me.
so if i look forward to the next decade, i'm sure two things that we can create any imagination, and that we can play all kinds of games. so i'm saying, let's start the world-changing games.
thank you.
" i've been interested in the placebo effect since then, and it's weird that a magician interested in it, it's because, you know, it's like me, " " a divergence that will be real when somebody's only enough believe enough. " "
in other words, sugar bonds have shown a messable effect, the placebo effect, and that's because the person thinks what you're going to happen is a pharmaceutical or a kind of. . . in the pain of pain, for example, there's only when the patient only believe
a deception becomes something real because somebody does it.
so to understand each other, i'd like to show you a fundamentally, very simple magic trick.
and i'm going to show you how it works. this is a trick that's been at least since the 1950s in every magic for children.
i learned it from the cub scout magic of the pathfinder in the 1970s.
i'm going to do it for you and then explain it.
and then i'm going to explain why i explain it.
so, look what happens.
the knife you can study; my hand you can study.
i'm just going to hold the knife like this in my axe.
i shoot my arms back.
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my arms or out of him, i'm just going to express my hands up here.
in this way, you can see that there's no time moving around, as long as i express here, nothing can change or come out in my arms.
and the goal is very simple.
i'm going to open my hand, and hopefully if everything goes well, knocks through my naked magnetism.
it's actually sitting there on his place that i can shake it without the knife down.
nothing goes into my arms or come out, no trickli. and you can study everything.
ta-da!
now, this is a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about deception, if you look closely, even though it's a very simple trick.
probably many of you in this room know this trick.
it works like this.
i hold the knife in my hand.
i'm saying that i'm going to leave my hands to make sure that there's nothing in my arms disappear or out there, and that's a lie.
the reason why i find my hands, is that there's the real secret of illusion.
the moment i'm going to go away from you, so you can see them from back, this finger here, my shower, just where he was, in a position where he was so extinct.
great trick?
there's somebody who had no childhood.
so, it's here. exactly.
and when i turn around, the finger changes its position.
and now you could talk about why this is a divergence, why you're not true that down here are just three fingers: because the way it's made of information, they don't pay one, one, two, three, but you see it as a group.
but that's not what it's about now. and then i open my hand.
of course, it's held there, but not by the magnetism of my body, but through a trick, through my shower, which is now there.
and when i go to my hand, the same thing is going to go back to me by walking through that movement, that the finger goes back.
i take this hand away. and here's the knife.
this trick can do their friends and neighbors. thank you.
now, what has that to do with the placebo effect?
a year ago or something, i read a study that really got me right.
i'm not a doctor or researchers, and so that was an amazing thing for me.
it turns out that if you offer a placebo in form of a white pill, in the form of aspirintablette, it's just a round, white pill that has a specific effect.
but if you put the shape where you put placebo, for example, in a smaller pill, and these blue colors and a letter on it, it's actually messable effective.
and that, even though not any of these pharmaceuticals. . . it's just sugarpilling.
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
what? that really made me look like.
but it turned out that that's not all that.
when you take the capsule, the even more effective than pigeons every form.
a color capsule that's yellow and on the other red, is better than a white cap.
also the dosage plays a role.
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills--i can't remember the exact statistics. sorry.
but the key thing is, . . .
. . . that also also play a role.
and the shape plays a role.
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect, you have to store the needle.
right? a syringe with a effective substance--a few milliliter of a effective substance that you inject a patient.
it creates a very strong image in your head. it's much stronger than a white pill.
this graph is really. . . i'm going to show you another time when we have a projector.
so the fact is that the white pill isn't as well as the blue pill that doesn't seem as well as a capsule that doesn't seem as well as the needle.
and nothing of it has some really pharmaceutical property. it's only our belief that we have in a stronger impact.
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick.
i'm going to take something that's obviously a deception, and let it look real.
we know from the study that you have to go to the needle when it's supposed to go.
this is a 18 centimeter long hutnadel. it's very, very spitz. and i'm going to die a little bit of sterilizing.
this is really my meat. it's not damian special meat.
this is my skin. this is not a special effect from hollywood.
i'm going to stumbled this needle into my skin, and i'm going through it through it until they're focusing on the other side.
if you're going to submit--if you're easy in ohnmacht--i've done this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room, and some people i didn't know, and it's got a woman almost ohnmachtable.
so i propose if you're going to get quick, you're looking for the next 30 seconds, or you know what, i'm going to make the first fierce part back here.
you can see it in the same, but you can look away when you want.
so, it's right here where my meat started, at the bottom part of my arms, i'm just going to just make a little shot.
does sorry. does this crazy?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side, again.
now we're in the same situation that we've had messertrick.
about it.
but now you can't pay my finger, right?
so, i'm going to show you. this is one, two, three, four, five.
well, yeah.
i know what people think when you see that.
" they say, " " okay, it's certainly not as stupid, and it's about the skin, just to hold us for a few minutes. " " "
well, then i'm going to show you.
what does this look like here? pretty good.
" yeah, i know. and people say, " " okay. i haven't seen that right. " " "
people in the side spaces are coming in.
let me show you a little bit.
this is really my skin. this is not a special effect from hollywood.
this is my meat, and i can turn it around.
sorry. if you're going to submit, look away, don't look.
" the people backwards or the ones that see this later on video will say, " " well, it looks pretty powerful, but if it was real, here's a hole, there's a hole, it would be flower. " " "
okay, let me give you a little blood for you.
yeah, here it is.
usually i would take the needle.
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds.
but i think in this frame here, and with the intention of making something real, i'm just going to leave the needle there and go from stage.
we're going to face a few times in the next few days.
i hope you're looking forward. thank you.
so i realized a lot of fish in my life.
i just loved two.
the first one that was more like a passionate of affare.
it was a beautiful fish, well-known, good accountable, conversationful, a bestseller on the menu.
what a fish.
better, in aquaculture, he'd be attacked after the supposedest standards of sustainability.
so you could feel that you could sell it.
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months.
one day, the boss of the company called and asked if i could talk to a event about the sustainability of the farm.
" " " of course, " " i said. "
here was a company trying to solve what has become this unpredictable problem for our cooks, how do we keep fish on our menu?
over the last 50 years, we've taken the oceans like we've beaten forests.
it's hard to convince the destruction.
90 percent of the big fish that we love, the tunas, the healing, the salmon, the salmon, heavyfish, they're collapsed.
it's almost nothing left.
so, probably, or ubel aquaculture, fisheries, is part of our future.
a lot of arguments about it. fish pollution the environment, most of you, and they're inefficient, we take tuna. a big disability.
he has a feed of 15 to one.
that means 15 pounds of wildfish to be needed to get a pound of layer.
not very sustainable.
don't taste very well.
so here was a company trying to do it right.
i wanted to support them.
day before the event, i called the head of public for the company.
let's call him don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " just to have the facts right, you're famous to build so far out in the sea that you don't grab the environment. " " "
" " " that's true, " " he said. " " we're so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed. " " "
" and then he added, " " we're basically a world. "
" this feed of 2.5 to 1, " " he said. "
" " " the best in the industry. " " "
2.5 to one, great.
" " " 2.5 to one? what did you feed? " " "
" " " sustainable proteins, " " he said. "
" " " great, " " i said. put up. "
and at that evening, i was in bed and thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein?
so i called the next day, just before the event, don.
" i said, " " don, what are sustainable proteins? " " "
he said he didn't know. he's going to ask.
now, i was phoneed with a few people in the company, and no one could give me a special answer, until finally, i finally got a biologist.
let's call him don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " what are sustainable proteins? " " "
well, he mentioned some algae and some fishhle, and then he said, chicken pellets.
" i said, " " chicken pellets? " " "
" he said, " " yeah, feathers, skin, bone deprivation, jarn, jack and worked with food. " " "
" i said, " " how percentage of your food is chicken? " " "
in the assumption, maybe two percent.
" " " well, these are about 30 percent, " " he said. "
" i said, " " don, what's sustainable about available to fish? " " "
" there was a long pause, and he said, " " there's too much chicken in the world. " " "
i went from this fish.
no, not because i'm a self-exaggerated and good job.
that's me even.
no, i've actually come to the fish from that fish, because, i'm swear to god, who's swore after that entertainment after chicken.
this second fish, which is a different kind of love history.
it's the romantic species, the way you know better you know your fish, you love the fish more.
first of all, i first eat him in a restaurant in southern india.
an amazing journalist has been talking about this fish for a long time.
it's got a bit wrong.
he came to the table with a bright, almost scanning white color.
the chef had dropped him.
hold twice.
amazingly he was still delicious.
who can make a fish so well after it would be done?
i can' t, but this guy can.
let's call it miguel. in fact, he's called miguel.
and no, he didn't cooked the fish, and he's not a chef. at least on the way you and i understand it.
he's a biologist at veta la palma.
this is a fish shot in the southwest spanish spaniens.
it's near the bottom of the rivers of guadalquivir.
until the 1980s, the farm was the hands of argentina.
they raised meat on what was basically wetsuit.
they made this by watering the country.
they built this complicated consequence of kanalen, and they pulled out water out of the country and out into the river.
now, you couldn't make sure that that's not economic.
and ecological was a disaster.
it took about 90 percent of the birds, which are many birds for this location.
and so 1982 has bought a spanish company with environmental awareness.
what did they do?
they've got the flow of the water.
they literally gave the lever.
instead of using water, they used the channels to put the water back again.
they started the channels.
they created a 11, 000 acres of fish--barsch, sea bottle, shrimp, aal--and they have miguel and his company completely reverse the ecological destruction.
the farm is incredible.
i mean, you've never seen anything like this.
they're taking out on the horizon, which is a million miles away, and all you're seeing are diminished channels and these density, ultraviolet march.
i was there no longer time with miguel ago.
" he's an incredible guy, three parts charles darwin and a part of" " a crocodile for kissing. " " "
okay? so there we were and fighting us through the wetlands, and i'm flipping and sweat, have matcally to my knees, and miguel hold a biology.
here he lifted a rare gleitaar.
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
and here, here he sees a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe.
it turns out miguel spent the greatest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa.
i asked him how it has become such a fish experts.
" he said, " " fish? i don't know about fish. "
" i'm an expert for relationships. " " "
and then he goes, and there's more of rare birds and algae and strange water plants.
and don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unprecedented, like this.
it's great, but i was in love with love.
and my head became faint about this little bit of delicious fish that i had ahead of.
" so i missed him. i said, " " miguel, what's it that your fish tastes so good? " " "
he showed up the algae.
" " " i know young, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships, that's incredible. "
but what does your fish eat?
" how about feed feed? " " "
now, he's left to tell me that it's such a rich system that the fish eats what you would eat in the wild.
the plantful biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, that's what the fish feeds.
the system is so healthy, it's completely self-protective.
there's no food.
anybody heard about a farm that doesn't feed their animals?
" later on that day, i went around with miguel, and i asked him, " " for a place that seems to be so natural, " " unlike every farm i've ever been, " " how do you succeed? " " "
in that moment, it was as if a filmregisseur had a stage for a stage.
and we bow around the corner, and we are the most incredible view, thousands and thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literally pink carpet so far the eye.
" " " that's success, " " he said. "
" " " look at your farmers, pink. "
" they're swimming. " " "
shit? i was completely confused.
" i said, " " miguel, don't you do your fish? " " "
" " " yes, " " he said. "
" " " we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish for the bird. "
well, last year, 600, 000 birds, over 250 different species.
it's the biggest one, and one of the most important private bird reserve in all of europe.
" and i said, " " miguel, isn't a good thorough bird sense the last one you want to have on a fish? " " "
he shake his head, no.
" he said, " " we're excited, not intense. "
this is an ecological network.
the flamingos eats the shrimp.
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
" so the pinker of the builder the better the system. " " "
okay, let's think about that. a farm that doesn't feed your animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators.
a fisherman, but also a bird reserve.
oh, and by the way, this flamingos of prescription shouldn't even be there.
they removed in a city of 240 kilometers where the soil unit is better for nesting.
every morning, they fly 240 kilometers to farm.
and every evening you fly back 240 kilometers.
they do that because they can follow the white line of the landscape of a92.
seriously.
i had a kind of journey of penguins, so i looked at miguel.
" i said, " " miguel, you fly 240 kilometers to the farm, and then you fly 240 kilometers back to the evening? "
" do that for children? " " "
he looked at me when i was just quoted a song of whitney houston.
" he said, " " no. you do that because food is better. " " "
i didn't mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious, and i don't like fish. i don't like it. i don't like it.
it's this leg, sales taste.
i almost never cook with it.
and yet, when i tried her in this restaurant in southspanien, she didn't taste after fish.
she tasted cute and rein, as if you would take a bit of the ocean.
i mentioned that against miguel and he nicd.
" he said, " " the skin works like a sponge. "
she's the last gun before something in the body.
" it's developed over the course of evolution to look unconditioned. " " "
" and then he added to him, " " but our water has no unimaginable. " " "
okay. a farm that doesn't feed their fish, a farm that measures her success at success.
and then i realized, if he says, a farm that has no unimaginable, he's understated because the water that's coming through this farm from the river of guadalquivir here.
it's a river that leads to all the things that rivers are today to lead them with, chemical pollutants, impacting pests.
and if it's taken through the system, and that's the water cleaner than it is.
the system is so healthy, it cleans water.
so not just a farm that doesn't feed their animals, not just a farm that misss their success on the health of their predators, but a farm that's literally a water on the water, not just for those fish, but also for you and me.
because when the water comes out, it assures it in the atlantic.
a drop in the ocean, i know, but i'm going to take it, and they should do it, because these love history, as romantic as it is, is also exploring.
you could say that it's a recipe for the future whether we're talking about bars or meat cortex.
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture, from one, actually tasted well.
but for many people, that's a little too radical.
we are not realists, we enjoy. we are lovers.
we love weekends. we love small families--we talk about regional food. we eat bio.
" and if you claim that these are the things that the future of good food keeps somewhere up and says, " " hey people, i love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world? "
" how are you going to feed the world? " " "
can i be honest?
i don't like that question.
no, not because we're making enough calories to feed the world more than just.
one billion people will starve today.
one billion--that's more than ever before--because of crazy inequality, not the total production.
now, i don't like that question, because it has the logic of our food system over the last 50 years.
" feeds of plants, pests of monocultures, chemicals to the earth, chickens on the earth, chickens of fish, and all the time, the agricultural industry has asked, " " if we feed more people cheap, how terrible can it be? " " "
that was the movement. it was the law. it was the business plan of american agriculture.
we should call them what she is, a framework in development, a materialius, that's rapidly environmental capital that enables exactly this production.
that's not a framework, and it's not agriculture.
our bodies today is threatening not because of abnehmender, but because of abnormal resources.
not through the latest mahdrescher and tractor inventions, but through fruit country, not by pumps, but by fresh water, not by chains, but by forests, and not by fishboats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
you want to feed the world?
let's start with the question: how are we going to feed ourselves?
or better, how can we create conditions that relate every community to feed themselves?
to do that, don't look at the agricultural industry model for the future.
it's really old, and it's done.
capital, chemistry and machines are up there, and it never produced something really good to eat.
let's look at the ecological model instead.
that's what we're looking back at two billion years of jobs.
look at miguel, farmers like miguel.
operating that aren't worlds, operatingness that are rebuild instead of abuse, operating, the extensiv, instead of intensive, farmers that are not only tools, but experts for relationships.
because they're the ones who are experts for taste.
and if i'm really honest, you're a better chef than i'm ever going to be.
you know, that's right to me, because if that's the future is good food, it will be delicious.
thank you.
i grew up with a part of science fiction.
in my school, i'm at the bus to school every day a hour.
and my nose is always in a book, a science fiction book that made my thought in other worlds, and in telling my profound way, my deep in me, satisfying curiosity.
" and this curiosity also showed that when i was not in school, through the forests of struggling, migrating and" " samples, " " frogs and coffee and ponds and ponds and ponds, everything brought home and under the microscope. "
i was totally excited, you know.
it was always trying to understand the attempt to understand the world and make the limits of possible.
and my love to science fiction seemed to resist in my environment, because back in the late' 60s, we flew to the moon and explore the deep sea.
jacques cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating program that showed us animals and places and a world of wonderful that we never imagine before.
that's probably what's going on with the science fiction role.
and i was an artist.
i could draw. i could paint.
and since there was neither video games still with computer tags, i had to create the whole screen in the media landscape, i had to create the images in my mind.
we all had to do that at that time. when we read a book, we took the description of the autors, and we put it on the screen in our heads.
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens, alien worlds, robots, spaces and all that.
in math class, i was always caught by the teacher, as i hidden behind textbooks.
creativity had to be kind of out.
and what happened was something interesting about jacques cousteauss fascinated me was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth.
i certainly wouldn't have to reach out a alien world with a spacecraft, and that seemed quite unlikely.
but here was a world that i could actually walk in here on earth, and she was as fascinating and exotic as all the stuff i'd always introduced when i read this books.
so i decided when i was 15, i decided to be diving.
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada, 000 kilometers from the next ocean.
but i didn't let it go.
i'm nervous my father, until finally he had made a dove school in buffalo, new york, looked extinct, just on the other side of the border where we lived.
i made my dive in a pool of ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo, new york.
but the ocean, a real ocean, i got to face two years later when we moved to california.
since then, in the 40 years, i've spent about 3, 000 hours underwater, 500 hours of it.
and i learned that the world of the deep oceans, even in the meat oceans, is so rich in fascinating life as we can really imagine it.
nature's imagination doesn't know borders, unlike our own, smart human imagination.
until today's days, i feel deepest honest for what i see on my dive.
and my love with the ocean, with the same intensity like eh and je.
when i looked at a job as an adult, it was the movies.
that seemed the best way of telling my inner drang telling stories, with my need to create images, to unite.
as a child, i used to draw comic books all the time.
so films of the way to bring pictures and stories together. that fits together.
" of course, the stories i've been looking out of the science fiction area: " " terminator, " " " " aliens, " " and" " abyss. " " "
i could connect my prescription for the underwater world and the dive with the films.
so my two passions sort of fell in.
" something interesting happened in" " abyss" " to solve a narrative problem in this film--we had to create some kind of liquid water--we put it on computer generated animation, cg, back. "
what came out was the first computer-generated soft surface figure that ever was in a movie.
the film didn't have a money, and in fact, he played his production costs, but i realized something fascinating: the audience around the world was like hypnotized from magic that came from it.
according to arthur clarke's law, there's no longer advanced technology and magic doesn't tell anymore anymore.
so they saw something magical.
and i found that exciting.
" and i thought to myself, " " wow, that needs to be in the movie artist. " " "
" so we went to" " terminator 2, " " my next film, even further. "
along with ilm, we created the guy out of liquid metal, and the success is about how this effect would come.
and it worked again. again, we created something magical, and the effect in the audience was the same, but we've got a little bit more money with the movie.
from these two experiences, there was a very new world, a whole new world of creativity for film damage.
" so i started a company with my good friend stan winston, who was the best make-up and creature designers called" " digital domain. " " "
the basic idea of this company was to translate the analoger processes with opera printers, etc. and start starting with digital production.
and then we did that, and we're going to make a time for a competition.
but in the mid-' 90s, we realized that in the creature and the character design, we actually founded the company--to slow down.
" i'd written this piece of" " avatar, " " which should be visual effects of visual effects and computer-generated effects in all new high effects, with realistic human, exaggerated characters that have been made by cg, and the mainfiguren should be all cg. "
but the messlatte looked very nice back, and the people in my company told me that we haven't been able to do that.
so i understand that, and i made this other film about the great ship that goes.
" the movie studio, i sold this as" " romeo and juliet on a ship" " and it became a lovely film of epic. "
but in fact, i really wanted to go down to the real crack of the titanic.
that's why i did the film.
that's the truth. the studio didn't know.
" but i've convinced you by saying, " " we've got to the wreck. we've filmed the real wreck. "
we're going to show it in the adult sequence of the film.
" that's really important. it's a good curtain for marketing. " " "
and i'm excited to fund a expedition.
sounds crazy. but that comes back to that, the imagination can create a reality.
we actually created six months later, a reality where i found myself in a russian divergence, four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic, and looked at the real titanic through a bullauge.
this wasn't a film, no hd, that was real.
so, that's really excited about me.
and we had to build cameras, and we had to build cameras and make it possible.
and i noticed how much these deep sea dives were similar to space.
well, they were also highly efficient planning.
you get into that capsule, you're floating down into this dark, hostile environment where there's no hope for rescue if you don't get it back.
" and i thought, " " wow, that's just as if i was in a science fiction film. "
" that's really cool. " " "
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea.
anyway, from the part to do with curiosity and science. it was all. it was adventure, it was curiosity. it was imagination.
and it was an experience that couldn't give me hollywood.
because, you know, i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect, but i couldn't imagine what i would see outside the window.
at some of the following expeditions, i've seen creatures in thermal sources, and sometimes things that i've never seen before, sometimes things that no one had ever seen before, and for the science, when we saw them, there was no words.
so that's really about me, and i wanted more.
and so i met a slightly unusual decision.
" after the success of" " titanic, " " i told myself, " " okay, i want to lay my chief as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice, and i'm going to go for a while-time researcher. " " "
and then we started planning these expeditions.
" we're going to dive to" " bismarck, " " and explore them with robots. "
we went back to the titanic wrack.
we took small robots that we built, which had a fiberglasl.
our intention was to go inside and look at the interior of the ship, which had never been done before.
no one had ever explore the inner of the wracks. you didn't have any means, so we developed the technology.
well, i'm sitting there, on the deck of the titanic, in a dive boat, and see planken, who's pretty similar to these dots here, and i know that einst played the band there.
and i'll fly with a little robotic vehicle through the gange of the ship.
i'm just really concerned about it, but my mind is within the vehicle.
it felt like i was physically in the shipwrack of the titanic table.
this was the surrealste form of a deja vu that i ever experienced, because before i go around a corner, i always knew what was going on in the light cycle of the vehicle, because i was running over months ago when we turned the movie.
the set was a precise copy of the bauplane of the ship.
so that was a highly strange experience.
she made this telepresence experience that you use such robotic avatars, and you can use your consciousness in the vehicle, in those other shapes of existence.
it was really profound.
and perhaps a little bit about what might happen in a few decades if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or to do other things in all sorts of post-human futures that i can imagine as a science fiction fan.
after these expeditions, we began to really appreciate what we've seen down, for example, these deep oceans, where we saw these incredibly amazing animals. these are sort of aliens, but here's earth.
they live with chemosynthesis.
they don't exist in a sunlight based on how we do that.
and so you can see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius.
water clouds live. and you can't imagine that they can survive there.
at the same time, i was also very interested in space science science-fiction influence from my childhood.
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are dealing with nasa, and they're sitting right now and they're going to go ahead and eat right space emissions, and they go through russia, through the mission, the biomedical protocol of everything from everything, and then
that was fascinating.
but at the end of that, i took space scientist with us in the deep sea.
and i took them with them, and i got them down to the world: astrobiologists, planet scientists, people who were interested in such extreme situations, and i took them to the source so they could look at samples and test instruments and so on.
we turned documents, but actually, science, actually said, space science.
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan, when i was a kid, and the conditions in reality.
in the course of this discovery, i learned a lot.
i learned a lot about science, but i also learned a lot about leadership.
now, you're sure, a director also needs to lead, be a leader like a shiplets or something.
but i don't understand much of leadership before i answer these expeditions.
" because at a particular point, i had to say, " " what am i doing here? "
" why am i doing that? what's going on? " " "
these bubble movies don't bring us any money.
we're just playing the production costs. it's not a trace.
" everybody think i've been gone between" " titanic" " and" " avatar, " " and somewhere i'd put the nail on a row on a row. "
i've made all these films, this documentary, for a very small audience.
no fame, no honor, no money. what are you doing?
you're doing it to the task will, to the challenge of will--and the ocean is the challenging environment that there are. you're doing it of the discoveries because of, and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people form a team.
because we've done all this with just 10 to 12 people who worked for years, and sometimes we were two to three months behind each other.
and in this community, you realize that the most important thing is the mind that you have in front of each other, because you have a task that you can't explain any other.
" and if you go back to the country, and you say, " " we had to do it, the fiberglas, the sound surveillance, and the whole thing, all the technology, and the difficulty, the human performance, if you work on sea, " " then you can't explain the other,
there's a connection, a mutual respect.
" so when i came back to turn my next film" " avatar, " " i tried to apply the same leadership, which is that you need to respect your team and deserve your respect. "
that's what the dynamics really changed.
" so i stood back with a little team on unknown terrain, and we're called" " avatar" " with a new technology that didn't have before. "
unfortunately.
an enormous challenge.
and we became a period of four and a half years to a right family.
it changed my way to make movies completely.
there were people who thought we were really good at this ocean and transporting the planet pandora.
to me, it was more a principle of doing my job, the real process that changed in the result.
so what can we close from all this?
what lessons have we learned?
i think first is the curiosity.
it's the most powerful human property.
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality.
and the mind of your team is more important than all the lorbees of the world.
" to me, young filmmakers, they say, " " give me a rat i can do something like this. " " "
" and i say, " " don't get yourself. "
" that's a others for you. don't stop yourself, don't bet against yourself, but take risks on you. " " "
" nasa has such an favorite one: " " failure is not an alternative. " " "
but in the art and the study in the study, it's got to be an alternative, because there's a confidence there.
none of the important consequences that innovation would ever be done without risk.
you have to be ready to take these risks.
that's the idea i'd like to share with you on the way. failure is a alternative, fear is not. thank you.
if i want to share one of the things that i want to share with you today is that the totalness of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their determination, and instead of thinking about information, i want you to think about how we can use information, that we can benefit that pattern and
so what we're seeing here is a typical sterbediagram of older age.
the program i'm using here is a little experiment.
it's called pivot, and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a particular cause, say we're wrong.
and immediately i see another pattern that makes you.
and that's because in the middle of the world, people are the most active, and they're over here over here.
we can go out a step further, and we can relax the data then and see that the cycle chain and cancer are the usual, but not for everyone.
now, if we go on and go older, say 40 years or younger, we see that accidents is even the main cause that people should worry about.
and who's noticed that this is particularly true of men.
so you realize that the view of information and data in this way is very swim in a living information world.
and if we can do this for raws, why not for content itself?
" what we've got here is the cover of every single" " sports illustrated, " " which have ever been printed. "
it's all here. it's all online.
you'd like to test it after my talk in their room.
with pivot, you can go to a decade.
you can go into a particular year.
you can jump directly to a particular task.
now, if i look here, i see the athletes that appear in this task and the sports species.
i'm an lance armstrong fan, so i click here, i'm all excited about what lance armstrong is mentioned.
" now, if i just want to get a sense of mind, i could think, " " ok, what if i look at all the bikes? " " "
so i go back to a step back and expand the perspective.
now i see greg lemond.
and so you get an idea that when you search through that kind of information, gezielter, broader, clean, smoking, you don't just add or surft.
you do something that's actually a little different.
it's something between, and we think it changes the way information can be used.
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with about what a little crazy.
what we've done here is we've taken every single wikipedia page and reduce it on a little summary.
the summary contains a short overlooked and a symbol for the area that it comes from.
i'll just show the top 500 of the popularest wikipedia page.
but even in this limited view, we can do lots of things.
immediately, we get an idea about the issues that are popularest on wikipedia.
i'm going to choose the subject of government.
" now, after i've chosen government, i realize that the wikipediakategories, most of the time magazines are the" " people of the year. " " "
this is really important because this is a realization that's not in a single wikipedia.
that's just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing.
" looking at a particular one of these collapses, i can go into the theme of time magazines, " " people of the year, " " and see everybody together. "
now, if i look at all these people now, i think the majority of government are government--some of them come from science. some, less, coming out of economics. here's my boss. and one comes from music.
and interestingly, bono is also a ted prize winner.
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winners.
you can see, we're surfing in the web as though it's really a nice, not just side to side, but a lot of abstract.
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise.
i'll just show you just the new york times website.
pivot, this application--i don't want to call it a browser; it's really not an browser, but you can look at websites with this--and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this.
so i can go back and jump right into a specific vision.
so that's important because you can only look through the web website in this kind of way, and you can look at all the internet cycle in the same way.
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular time.
here's the whole demonstration that i've been running up here.
and i can sort of look at everything i've looked at today.
and, if i go back to a step, and i look at everything, maybe i can redesign my course after my addiction, and here, i looked for a nepotistisch, here's bing, or here, live labs pivot.
and from here i can go into the page and put them back.
it's a metaphor that's used to be used again, and every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data.
right now, in this world, we think data is a flight.
we're talking about the flight of the information cycle.
we're talking about drowning information.
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head so that instead of walking from one another, instead of starting to go from many things to many things, and recognize patterns that otherwise have happened?
if we can do that, then these sophisticated data will become a new source of information.
and, instead of just moving in information, we can get it.
and if we know, then we can even pull wisdom from that.
so i stopped, thank you very much.
everybody talks about happiness today.
i have some people pay the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years, and they gave up about 40, and there was a lot more.
there's a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers.
there's a lot of happiness coaching.
everybody would like to make people happier.
but despite all these tides of work, there are several cognitive cases that make it almost impossible to think about happiness.
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive cases.
it's true for louder that think about their own happiness, and it's true for scientists thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're as much as everybody else.
the first of these cases is a resilient to give complexity.
it turns out that happiness is just not a useful word, because we apply it to many different things.
i think there's a certain importance that we could make it, but in the big and all of that is something we need to be stopped, and we're going to have to take the complicated view of what's well-being.
the second cases is a sense of experience and memory: basically it's between being happy in his life and happiness about his life or happy with his life.
and these are two very different concepts, and they're both in the idea of happiness.
and the third one is the concentration illusion, and that's the unhappy fact that we can't think about an circumstances that affect well without distorted its meaning.
i mean, that's a real cognitive cases.
there's just no way to get it right.
now, i'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer sitting after one of my lectures who reported a story. [unclear. . . . ] he said he'd heard a sinfonie, and it was absolutely proper music, and it was at the end of the
and then he added, really quite emotional, that ruined the whole experience.
but that didn' t.
what it ruined was the memories of the experience.
he had the experience.
he had had 20 minutes of wonderful music.
they didn't pay because he was spreading with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all he got to keep.
what really tells us is that we could think about us about other people in the sense of two kinds of self.
there's a experience that lives in the present and the present knows, is able to experience the past, but basically the present has only been the present.
" it's the experience of the doctor--you know, if the doctor asks, " " does it hurt when i'm here? " " "
" and then there's a memory self, and the memory self is that, which is telling us and the story of our lives right now, and it's the one that the doctor's working by saying, " " how did you feel? " " "
" or" " how was your journey to albania? " " or something like that. "
these are two very different units, the experience itself and the memory itself, and the two of them is part of the notion of happiness.
well, memory self is a storyteller.
and that's really starting with a fundamental response on our memories--it's starting immediately.
we don't just tell stories when we do telling stories.
our memory tells us stories, which means what we're able to do about our experiences is a story.
and let me start with an example.
there's a old study.
these are real patients who are understated a painful procedure.
i'm not going to go into detail. it's not more painful now, but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s.
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain.
and here are two patients. these are their record.
" and you're going to ask, " " who has more loved? " " "
and that's a very simple question.
patient b clearly has more yellow. his representation was longer, and every minute of pain, the patient a had patient b and more.
" but now there's another question: " " how much these patients thought they were suffering? " " "
and here's a surprise.
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse erinn to the representation as patient b.
the stories of the representations were different, and because it's a very critical part of the story as it ends.
and none of these stories are very powerful or great--but one of them is this clear. . . but one of them is clearly worse than the other.
and the, the worst is, where pain was at the end of his peak, it's a bad story.
how do we know that?
" because we asked these people after their representation, and also a lot later, " " how bad was the whole thing? " " "
and she was much worse for a than for b in the erinn.
well, that's a direct conflict between the experience self and the memory self.
from the experience of the experience, b clearly had a bad time.
well, what you could do with patient, and we actually did clinical experiments, and it's been done, and it's actually done, and it's actually done, you could actually extend the representation of patient a.
that's going to lead that the patient is suffering, but just a little less than before.
and if you're doing this for a few minutes, you're confusing that the experience of patients is a bad one, and you've gotten that patients' patients are much better, because now you've given patient a better story about his experience.
what does a story do?
and that's true of the stories that memory us, and it's also true for the stories we're invent.
it's a story that's signed up to be breakthroughs, important moments and end.
it's very, very important, and in this case, the end.
well, the experience itself lives physically alive.
it has eyes of experience one after another.
and you say, what's going on with these moments?
and the answer is really simple. they're lost forever.
i mean, most moments of our lives--and i've been excited--you know, psychological present than about three seconds long, which means that there's about 600 million in a life, in a month, there's about 600, 000. most of you don't leave
most of you are completely ignored by memory itself.
and yet, you get the impression that you should count that what's happening during this moment of experience is our lives.
it's the limited resource that we use during the world.
and as we consume them, it's seemingly seemingly important, but that's not the story that the memory self for us.
so we have the memory self and experience ourselves, and they're really different.
the greatest difference between them is time.
from the view of the experience itself, if you have a vacation, and the second week is exactly as good as the first one, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the vacation vacation.
that's not how that works for memory itself.
for the memory itself, a two-week vacation is hardly better than the housing vacation, because there's no new memories to be added.
they didn't change the story.
and in this way, time is the critical variable that is different from a experience self, and time has very little impact on that story.
now, memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories.
it's actually the one that's true of choices, because if you have a patient, who, say we had two representations in two different surgeons and decide which to vote, then the one that's picked up the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that' s
the experience itself has no voice in that choice.
actually, we don't choose between experiences. we choose between memories of experiences.
and even if we think about the future, we usually don't usually think of our future as an experience.
we think about our future as predictable memories.
and basically, you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of memory itself, and you can think of the memory itself as one, which means that the experience itself needs through experiences that the experience itself doesn't need.
i have the impression that if we do urlaub is the very common case, which means we make urlaub far away in the service of memory itself.
and that's a little hard to do, i think.
i mean, how much are we going from our memories?
this is one of the explanations that's given for the dominance of memory itself.
and when i think about it, i think of a vacation that we've done in antarctica a few years ago, the clearly of the best urlaub that i had ever had, and i think relatively often in the relationship of how often i think of other vacation.
and i've probably heard about my memories of these three-week journey, and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years.
now, if i had ever opened the order with the 600 images, i spent another hour.
now, these are three weeks, and these are highest a half a half.
there seems to be an impulse.
now, i like to be a little extreme, you know, how little appetite i have on the time of memory, but even if you're doing more of it, there's a real question, why are we giving memories so much weight in the way that we're seeing?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment.
imagine your next vacation, you know, at the end of the vacation, all of your images will be raised, and you get an amnestic drug, so that they're not going to remember anything.
now, would you choose the same vacation? and if you choose another vacation, there's a conflict between your two kinds of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict, and that's not really obvious, because if you think of time, you get a answer, and if you
why we look at the vacation we're looking at is a problem with a choice between the two kinds of self.
now, the two kinds of self throw up two things from happiness.
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self.
so you can ask: how happy is the experience itself?
and then you would ask yourself: how happy are the moment in life of the experience themselves?
and they're all--happiness is a pretty complicated process.
what are the emotions that can be measured?
and by the way, we're now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experience of the time.
if you ask the happiness of the memory self, it's a very different thing.
that's not about how happy a person lives.
it's about how satisfying or enjoying the person when these person think about their lives.
very different terms.
everybody who doesn't have that term is going to convey the exploration of happiness, and i'm going to have a lot of researchers about well-being that exploration of happiness have long on exactly the same way.
the distinction between the happiness self and the happiness of memory itself has been recognized in the last few years, and now you're looking at measuring the two of them.
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences, and there were other efforts in the direction.
so over the last few years, we started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self.
and the main lesson that we, i think have learned that they're really different.
you can know how happy someone is with his life, and you can't really teach them a lot about how happy he lives and reverse.
just to give you a sense of correlation, the correlation is about five.
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody, and you would tell them, oh, his father is a two-meter man, how much would you know about his size?
well, you would know about his size, but there's a lot of uncertainty.
they have so much uncertainty.
if i tell you that somebody else has eight on a scale of 10geordnet, they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his experience.
so the correlation is small.
we know about what the happiness of happiness itself is.
we know that money is very important, goals are very important.
we know that happiness is mostly meant to be satisfied with people we like, spend time with people we like.
there are other pleasure, but that's dominant.
so if you want to maximize the happiness of self, you're going to do very different things at the end.
the conclusion from what i've said here is that we shouldn't really imagine happiness as a commodities for well-being.
it's a completely different term.
now, very short, another reason we can't realize about happiness is that we don't look at the same things when we think about life, and when we actually live.
so if you ask the simple question, as happy as people in california are not going to get the correct answer.
if you ask that question, you think that people in california have to be happier if you say, in ohio, we live in.
and what's happening is that when you think about life in california, think about the difference between california and other places, we say, in climate.
well, it turns out that climate isn't very important for the experience itself, and it's not even very important for the respect self that decides how happy people are.
now, because the next self is responsible, you can end--some people could go to california at the end.
and it's kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who move to california to become happier.
now, your experience itself is not going to be happier.
we know that.
but one thing will happen. you'll think they're happier, because if you think about it, you'll remind you about how terrible the weather was in ohio, and you'll feel that you've met the right decision.
it's very hard to think about well-being, and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. i have a question for you.
thank you.
now, when we set up a couple of weeks ago, they mentioned that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup.
is this something that you can participate in because you've got a few minutes?
daniel kahneman: sure.
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup polls is a number we had absolutely not expecting.
we found that in terms of the happiness of experience itself.
if we looked at how emotions are playing with income.
and it turns out that under a income of 60, 000 dollars a year, for americans, and that's a very large sample of americans, about 600, 000, but it's a big representative sample under a income of 600, 000 dollars a year.
ca: 60, 000.
dk: 60, 000.
60, 000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they're increasingly unfortunate, the poorr they're going to become.
that's what we're getting about is an absolute surface line.
i mean, i've rarely seen as flat lines.
what happens is, obviously, money hasn't done one happiness happiness, but that lack of money make surely miserable, and we can measure this misery very, very clearly.
in the sense of the other self, the memory itself, you get another story.
the more money you deserve the more happiness.
it's not true of emotions.
ca: but danny, in the entire american goals, it's about life, freedom, the pursuit of happiness.
if people were to take this evidence seriously, i mean, it seems to be all about the head, anything we think we believe, for example, in terms of tax politics and so on.
is there a chance that politicians that the country generally would take a befund like the serious and make politics based on?
dk: you know, i think there are recognition for the role of happiness in politics.
the recognition will slow down into the united states, no question, but in the united kingdom, it's happening right now, and in other countries, it's happening right now.
the people are to admit that they should think of happiness when they think about politics.
it's going to take a while, and people will discuss if they want to explore experience happiness, or whether they want to explore life ratings, so we need to lead this discussion quite soon.
as you can increase happiness, very different depending on how you think and whether you think of the memory of yourself, or whether you think of the experience itself.
that's going to influence politics, i think in the years.
in the united states, you're looking at measure the experience happiness of the population.
that's going to be, in the next one or two decades, i think, is part of the national statistic.
ca: well, it seems to me, this topic will be, or at least the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years.
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics.
thank you, danny kahneman.
today i'm talking to you about energy and climate.
and this may surprise something because my full-time position in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds, to provide things that we need and provide to allow the poorest two billion a better life.
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people, actually more important than anybody else on the planet.
climate change means that their seeds are not going to grow over many years, and we're too much raining, and things are going to change as much as it can't change their women's environment.
it leads to hungersterben. it leads to uncertainty. it leads to inadequate.
so, a climate change becomes terrible for them.
also, the energy price is very important for them.
the fact is that if you could reduce just one thing, one thing that you could reduce, it would be energy in most effective.
well, the energy price has fallen over time.
in fact, the progress of energy is based on energy steps.
the kohlerevolution drinks the industrial revolution, and even in the 20th century, there was a rapid case in electricity, and so we have refrigerators, climate change, we can make modern materials and do so many things.
so we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
but if we reduce the price--let's cut the price--we meet a new barrier, and these barriers are related to co2.
co2 warmed the planet, and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear.
they summarize the extinct co2 that leads to temperature, and these temperatures have some very negative consequences, effectively on the weather, and maybe worse, the indian consequence that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt those kinds of kinds of changes, and so all systems together.
well, the exact relationship between a co2 increase and the interaction of temperature and where their other consequences are, there's a couple of uncomfortable, but not many.
and there's certainly sure about how bad these consequences are, but they're going to be extremely bad.
" i asked the top scientists mehrmals: " " do we really have to get down to zero? "
" isn't half or a quarter? " " "
the answer is, until we get zero, the temperature will continue.
that's why it's a big challenge.
it's very different than to say, we have a 3.5 high truck that has to be under a 3 meters, and then you can go underneath it.
this has to go down, on zero.
well, we're spending a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion tons of tons.
every americans about 20 tons. people from poor countries, less than one.
it's about five tons of everybody on the planet.
and somehow we have to create changes that flourishing on zero.
it's so constant.
only different economic changes have influenced it at all, and we have to go from rapid rise to zero.
this equation has four factors. a little bit of multiplication. you have this thing left carbon--which you want to get towards zero, and that's going to be dependent on the number of people, from the service that each person uses average, the average energy for every service and the carbon, which is
so let's take a look at every factor and think about how we get this on zero.
probably one of those numbers has to come very close to zero.
now that's basic algebra, but let's go through it.
first of all, we have the population.
today 6.8 billion people today.
and it's writing at nine billion. it's moving to nine billion.
if we're very successful with new vaccines, healthcare and reproductive money, we've probably been able to lower this about 10 percent to 15 percent, but at the time, we're seeing a rising for 1.3.
the second factor is the service we use.
that involves everything that we eat, clothing, television, heat.
these are very good things and poverty changes to make these services almost everybody on the planet.
it's great that this number goes up.
in the rich world, in the upper billion, we could probably make it waste and use less, but average is going to increase that number every year, and so much more than doubled, the number of service per person will be willing.
so here we see a very fundamental service. is there at home light so you can read the homework?
and these students don't have it, so they go out and read their shoes under the streets.
now, in effectiveness, the e, the energy per service, there are finally good news.
we have something that doesn't increase.
because different successs in the light sector, through other automated, through new methods, there are lots of services that energy can lower them, can be dramatically behave, 103 00: 05: 05: 50, 000--05: 05: 05: 05: 53, 000.
some individual services reduce 90 percent.
in other services, like the idea of fertilizer, 105 00: 05: 56, 000--05: 05: 05: 58, 000 or the airverkehr or air transportation, the game room for improvements is much smaller.
in fact, if we're optimistic, maybe we'll get a factor three or maybe even a factor six.
but in the first three factors, we've gone from 26 billion on maybe 13 billion tons of ton. and that's not enough.
so let's look at the fourth factor--and that's going to be a key factor--that's the amount of carbon that is emitting per energy.
it's the question of whether you can get this on zero.
if you burn coal, no.
if you burn natural gas, no.
almost every shower for electricity is co2 today, except renewable energy and nuclearrgie.
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system.
we need energy.
" now, if i use the term" " miracle, " " i don't mean the impossible. "
the microprocessor is a miracle. the pc is a miracle.
the internet and the service is a miracle.
people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these wonder.
usually there's no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date.
normally, you're just wrong, and some people don' t.
but in this case, we have to give up full gas and get a miracle in very short time.
now, i wondered, how can i really get this?
is there a natural illustration, there's a demonstration of people's idea here?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoos, and somehow people want this.
the idea was really grateful for them, you know, there are people living with mosquitos.
for energy, this is what i got here.
i decided that this was unfortunate by happiness, my year-old contribution would be here.
so here's a couple of natural happiness.
you assure me that it's not going out. in fact, you're not going to leave the glass.
well, there's all kinds of toys like this, but they don't get much.
we need solutions either either or several who have an unpredictable scale and unpredictability, and even though there are lots of directions where people are looking for, i'm really just seeing five that can afford these big challenges.
i left tide, geothermal, fusion and biofuels.
these are perhaps a moderate contribution, and if you afford better than i expect, that would be great, but my core thing here is that we have to work on all those five, and we can't stop up because they're shy, because they're significant problems.
let's look at the burning fossil fuels, burning by either coal or natural gas.
what you've got to do there, maybe it's easy, but it's not. you had to get all the carbon that comes after the burnstone, start using pressure, and then you hope and hope it's staying there.
there are some pilot projects that create this on a 60 percent level of 80 percent, but it's got to get 100 percent very difficult to get a co2, and it's a challenge for the co2. but the biggest problem here is the storage question.
who will make it safe?
who can guarantee something, literally, many billion times bigger than any kind of trash you can imagine from nuclear and other things?
that's a lot of volume.
so that's a hard use.
next: nuclearrgie.
they also have three big problems too. the cost of high-cost countries are high, and the question of safety that you really feel that you really feel nothing can go wrong despite the human employees that the fuel is not used for guns.
and then what do you do with the waste?
because even though it's not very big, there's a lot of concerns.
people have to feel good at that. 184 00: 10: 20, 000--so, 00: 10: 10, 000, three very difficult problems that might be delete.
so three very difficult problems that maybe matter, and that's why you should work.
the last three of the five i've been trying to draw.
they're renewable energy as they're often called.
and they also have--even though it's great that they don't need fuel--they have some nights.
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically less than the forces of forces.
these are energy farms, you're talking about many square kilometers, thousand times more flat than a normal force.
and also, these sources are underestimated.
the sun doesn't seem all day, it doesn't seem every day, and it's as well as the wind is not constantly constantly.
that's why you have to, if you're dependent on these sources, you have a way to get the energy in times when it's not available.
so there's big preishera challenges here. there are challenges in transmission, and if we say that the energy source is outside of the country, they don't just need to deal with the technology, they also need to deal with the risk that the energy comes from.
and there's the design problem.
and to show the dimension, i have all sorts of batteries that are made, looking at cars, computers, cell phones, pockets, for everything. and that's what i've got with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world. i found that all the batteries that we now produce
so we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 than the approach to time.
it's not impossible, but it's not so easy.
that's what happens when you try to get these interconnected sources about saying 20 percent of the consumer.
if you want to go to 100 percent on it, you need an incredible miracle.
now, where are we going to go: what's the right approach?
" a" " manhattan project? how are we going to go? "
what we need is a lot of companies working on it. hundreds.
every one of these five areas, we need at least 100 people.
in many ways, they will say, they're crazy! that's good.
i think there's a lot in the ted group that are already engaging there.
bill gross has several companies, among other things, one called esolar has the great solar-powered technologies.
invest in a dozen companies in dozen companies that make great things and have interesting possibilities and i'm trying to support that.
nathan myhrvold and i funded a company that maybe surprised the nuclear approach.
there are some innovations in nuclear collision; modular, liquid.
the development has stopped in this industry ago, so it's not a big surprise that some good concepts are running around.
the terrapower concept means that instead of an part of the uranium, one percent, the u235, we decided to burn the 99 percent, the u238.
this is a pretty crazy idea.
but in fact, you've been thinking about it for a long time, but you could never simulate whether it would work, but since then, modern supercomputers, you can simulate it and see that: yeah! with the right materials, it looks like it works.
and because you connect these 99 percent, the cost of cost is much better.
in fact, you burn the trash, and you can even use the waste of today's reactors as a drive.
rather than break the head about it, they just burn it. a great thing.
the ancient one is used to be a little bit like a candle.
" you can see that it's sort of a column, often as" " wandernde wave reactor. " " "
that really solves the fuel problem.
here's a picture of a place in kentucky.
that's the waste, the 99 percent. you have the part that's spreading today, so it's called the ancient uranium.
that triggers the u. s. for hundreds of years.
and if you have oceanwater cheap and just filtriert, you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet.
you know, there's a lot of challenges there, but it's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward.
let's think about how to measure our success.
what should we look like?
now, let's go to the goal we need to reach, and then we talk about the between.
a lot of talk about a 80 percent reduction to 2050.
it's really important that we get there.
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries, and there's still something agriculture, and hopefully forest and time will be clean to it.
so to reach these 80 percent, the industries countries, including countries like china, their electricity policy.
the other note tells whether we use zero emissions, whether it's used in all the developed countries, and we're on the way to get them to the rest.
that's great.
this is going to be a key issue of this stuff.
if we go back from there, what should the 2020 look like?
it should be the two elements again.
we should use the effective effects to get reduction on the way, the less we emittize, the less is going to be the carbon sum and also the temperature.
but actually, this note for the things that we're doing, which doesn't completely lead to the great reductions, just equal, or even less important as the other, which is the rapidity of innovation for these breakthroughs.
these breakthroughs, we have to follow full gas, and we can measure this: in corporate projects, in pilot projects and regulation.
there's a lot of great books to this issue.
" the al gore book" " we have the choice and david mckays" " sustainable energy without the hot air. " " "
they really go through it, and they create a framework where this can be wide, because we need support for all sides.
there are some things that have to come together.
that's a wish.
a very specific desire that we're invent this technology.
if you're just a wish for the next 50 years, i could choose the president, a vaccine, and i love, or i could choose this wish, which is half-sacred energy without co2. that wish i took.
this has the greatest impact.
if we don't get this wish, the digits between long-term and short-term thinking will be horrible between the united states and china, between the u. s. and poor countries, and almost all of these two billions are going to be much worse.
so what do we have to do?
for what measures i appeal?
we need to use more research for more research.
if countries are meeting in places like coppenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about co2.
they were supposed to talk to these innovation strategy, and they were spare by the ridiculous amount of money spent for these innovative approach.
we need market incentives, co2 control, cap& amp; trade something that creates a price.
we need to spread the message.
we need to have dialogue rational and complete, and also the things that are being taken by government.
it's an important wish, but i think we can fulfill him.
thank you.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. thank you.
thank you very much. just to understand terrapower better--first, can you give us an idea of magnitude of this investment?
bill gates: to do the simulation on a supercomputer, to get all the big scientists we've done, we just need some 10 million, and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works, you're only in 100 million.
the hard steps is building the first reactor to find more billions, the regularia and the place that actually build the first of them.
once the first deal is done when it's walking like hidden, it's all very clear, because the economic poetry, the energy density is so different from the nuclearrgie as we know it.
ca: so to understand that, that means deep in the ground almost like a vertical mammalian fuel, this consumer uranium, and then the process begins up and works down?
bg: exactly. today you have to rehabit the reactor, so there's a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong, and that thing you open it up or out. that's not good.
but if you have very cheap fuel, you can fill it for 60 years--think about a column that's buried without all the complexity.
and it's sitting there for 60 years, and it's been done.
ca: a nuclear reactor that itself offers a solution for the waste.
bg: yeah. well, what happened with the waste: you can sit it--there's a lot less waste with this method--then take it and pack it in the next reactor and burn it on.
and we start by taking the trash that exists in these refrigerator or dry content, which is our startpelled.
so what this reactor was a problem for these reactors, which we fill in and so that the garbage will reduce dramatically during this process.
ca: but while you've talked to different people in the world about these possibilities.
where's the biggest interest, what's really about?
bg: now we haven't set up to a place yet, and there's a lot of interesting open records for everything the nuclear, and there's great interest and the people of the company were in russia, india, china. . . i've been here, and talked about the energy
i'm optimistic. you know, the french and japanese have done something in the direction.
this is a version of one thing done.
this is an important step forward, but it's like a quick reactor and some countries built this, so everybody who's implemented a rapid reactor, a candidate for our first.
ca: in your imagination: time frame and probability to really call it?
bg: now, we need one of these scales--straiting things that are very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then to use 20 years.
so that's sort of the deadline that's placed us the environment that we need to hold.
and, you know, terrapower, if everything goes well, and that's a big wish, it might be easy.
and fortunately, there are dozens of companies today, and we need hundreds of things that are, as much as their approaches work, the demand for their pilots to offer it.
and it would be best when it builds several, because then you could use a mixture.
anyway, we need a solution.
ca: do the big possible breakthrough, is this the biggest thing you know?
bg: an energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
it would also be without the environmental therapy, but it's been so much more important.
in nuclear sector, there are other innovative companies.
you know, we don't know their work as well as these, but there's the modular technique, which is another approach.
there's a liquid reactor that seems to be hard, but maybe they say about us.
and so there are different, but the beautiful thing about this is that a ancient molecule has a million times as much energy, say, a coal molecule, and therefore, if you can deal with the problems, and they're mainly the radiation, the footprint and the cost, the potential, so the
ca: if that doesn't work, what then?
do we have to raise emergency action to try to keep the stabil stabil?
bg: if you come to this situation, it's like you've forgotten too much, and it's about a heart attack. what do you do then? you might need a heart attack or anything.
there's a research research called the geoengineering, which is called different techniques to delay the warming so that we had 20 or 30 years longer to bring us together.
this is just an insurance level.
you hope we don't need that.
some people say you shouldn't have to work on insurance because you might be able to go wrong so that you're going to eat, because you know, you're going to save your heart power.
i don't know if the smart thing is, if you're the importance of this problem, but there's now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have to have that, if things come faster, or that innovation needs longer than we expect.
ca: climate change: do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you?
bg: well, unfortunately, skeptics live in very different camps.
those who make scientific arguments are very little.
you say there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that are different?
there are very, very few things that you can say, of which there's a chance in a million.
the main problem here is as similar as aids.
you make the mistake now, and you pay a lot later.
and so the idea is, now, if you have all sorts of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later--and that's because the investment isn't so clear, the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world looking
the fact is that the uncertainty should worry about us.
" but my dream here is that if you can make it economic, and at the same time, the carbon, the skeptics say, " " okay, it doesn't care that it's not a co2, i wish it's the fact, but i'm probably accepting it
ca: and that would be your answer to the bjorn lomborg argument, that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem, all the other goals below underneath, the poverty of malaria, and so on, it's a stupid waste of resources to invest
bg: well, the actual spending for research--let's say the u. s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today--that's not so dramatic.
there shouldn't be other things about it.
you get too big money, and here you can resist reasonable people, if you have something that's not economic and try to fund that. for me, most of us, most waste is happening.
it's because you're very short before a free breakthrough, and it's only the learning system, and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much more cheaper.
if you get the treaty that you get, it's a very high energy price, it's just the rich.
i mean, every one of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle.
but for the lower two billion, it's a disaster.
and even lomborg thinks about it.
" his new masche is now, " " why don't research anymore? " " "
he's still going to associate because of his former stories, with the skeptic camp, but he understood that this is a very lonely group, and so now he's now making the research.
and that's a thought that i think is appropriate.
the research, it's just crazy, just how little that's supported.
ca: bill, i think i'm talking to almost everybody here if i say, i really hope you're going to be true. thank you so much.
bg: thank you.
i'd like to tell you a little bit about what i'd like to do with a couple of months ago when i write a paper for italian wired.
" i've always write my synonym-dictionaries, but i've been done with the bearh of the textes, and i noticed that i've never done in my life, which really means" " disadvantage. " " "
i read the talk.
" " " disabled, " " helpless, helpless, useful, disgusted, declining, declining, declining, tears, paralyzed, paralyzed, impotent, impotent, paralyzed, paralyzed senil, paralyzed,
antonyme: healthy, strong, powerful.
" i read this list of a friend loud, and i had to laugh it so ridiculous, but i just came up until" " approach, " " and i couldn't go anymore, and i had to stop reading, and i'm just collecting, and i'm collecting
of course, this was an amazing, oldest synonym-dictionaries, and i just thought that the task needs to be pretty old.
but in fact, it was a task on the early' 80s, when i was starting to start with the elementary school, and i started building my self-image outside of my family environment and shape, in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me.
and thank god, i didn't use synonym-dictionaries at that time.
if i were to take this talk seriously, i was born in a world that would have a person like me as a person whose life can't be positive, but today i'm going to go to the chance and adventure that i've experienced.
so i immediately got up to the online issue of 2009, and expect me to find out here.
here's the actualized version of this talk.
unfortunately, it's not much better.
" in particular, the last two words under" " near antonyms" " and" " healthy. " " "
but it's not just about words.
it's about what we think about the people we describe with these words.
it's about the values that stick in these words, and how we construct these values.
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us.
a lot of aging societies, including the greeks and the rome, have really believed that the conversation of a river has a big force, because what you can manifest out of it is also manifest.
so what do we actually want to manifest--a disabled person or a powerful person?
just to pay attention to a human being eightless than a kid could be able to convey them, and to give them ideas.
wouldn't it be nice to open them?
a person who opened door for me was my children's a. i. dupont institut in wil toma in delaware.
it's called dr. pizzutillo. it's a italo american, whose name, as you can think, most americans couldn't get correct. so he's called dr. p.
and dr. p. wore very bunons of flies and was simply working with children.
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great--up to my physiotherapy.
i had to be infinitely remarkably often with these thick, elastic banders--in different colors--you know, to build my leg muscle, and i've heard more than anything else. i hated them. i hated them. i hated them.
and imagine i've been negotiating as five-year-old kid with dr. p. and so trying to stop these exercises without success.
" and one day he watched me with one of my exercises--these exercises were just flooded and gnadenless--and he said to me, " " wow, aimee, you're such a strong, powerful and young girl, you're going to break one day one of
" and if you do it, i give you a hundred dollars. " " "
this was, of course, a simple trick of dr. p. so i do make the exercises i didn't want to do, with the prospect that richest five-year-old girls in the second floor, but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes, so it
and i wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl, my self-imagery, and i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature, powerful and breathing human beings.
this is just an example of many, as adults in power records can expect the imagination of a child.
but like the already quote examples of the synonym-dictionaries, our language doesn't have a room to imagine what we all wanted to know: to allow every single one to see themselves as powerful people.
our language goes back to the social changes that have gone through a technological change.
now, of course, from medical view, you can say that my legs, the laser surgery for sehbe, mirrors from titan and artificial hats for aging bodies that allow people to really use all of their possibilities and develop beyond the borders that you have, not to talk about social networking
and with that, in the world, it's increasing groups that they're exploring themselves.
so perhaps this technological change is clear because ever that there was always a different truth, which is that every human being of society can give a very special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus.
now, the human ability to adapt--this is an interesting story, because people ask me to tell me about how to deal with widrigkeits and i'm going to tell you something: this sentence never missed for me, and i've always felt very uncomfortable with answering the questions
so this sentence of widrigkeits live by the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being collected by being connected experience, as if my life would be so successful because i could make the possible of a life with a prosthetic, or whatever people think of me with my disability.
but the truth is that we change ourselves. of course we're wearing from the challenge, whether it's physically, emotional or even both.
and i'm saying that that's good.
widrigkeits are not obstacle that we need to be more comfortable to get better with our lives.
widrigkeits just belong to our lives.
and i tend to see widrigkeits as my shadow.
sometimes i realize that he's very presentation, sometimes he's hard to see, but it's all about me.
and i don't want to put the impact on it, and the heavy of the fight of a human being.
there are widrigkeits and challenges, and they're only all the same real and every person is about to deal with widrigkeits or not, but the question is not whether we're getting clear or not, but how we get clear.
so we're not just responsible for people that we love before destiny, but they're also willing to prepare well with it.
and we don't tell our children if we give them the sense that they can't adapt.
you've got to understand two things: one of the health cares to be amputing and to others the social opinion about whether i'm behindzed or not.
and to be honest, the only real and staying disability that i had to set up with is that the world is constantly saying, you can describe me with these definitions.
in our desire to protect the people who are on heart and fill them the cold, hard truth about their medicines, or even a forecast for life that they expect, we have to admit that we don't have to put the property that somebody's actually disagree.
maybe the moment concept that only minds about what's broken, and how we fix it, for every single one of them, a bigger disability than the pathology.
if we're not treating a human being, and we're not going to perceive all of his forces and possibilities, we're creating in addition to the natural fight you might have to lead another disease.
we degrade a person who has a value for our society.
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the field of human possibilities.
but most importantly, there's between the perception of our impossibility and our great inventor, there's a connection.
we shouldn't have these challenges of times, we shouldn't try and avoid them, we shouldn't try to avoid them, but we should be able to see them underneath the carpet, but it's about seeing in the willingness.
it might be more likely to make sure that we don't need to overcome widrigkeits, but that we're open to humility, to humility, to put them on the creation, to use a struggle, and perhaps to dance with it.
and maybe we're creating widrigkeits than something natural, right and useful and useful, and we don't feel so stressed through their presence.
in this year, we celebrate the 200 birthday of charles darwin, and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago, darwin, in my eyes, on something very true in human nature.
i would write it like this: not the most strongest of its kind, and also not the smartest of its way, but the one who can adjust change best.
conflict comes from creativity.
not only from darwin's work, we know that the ability of the people to survive and to survive, is determined by the struggle of human mind to change through conflict.
so again, change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans.
and maybe we know about what wood we're carrying when we're really checking.
perhaps that's the sense of widrigkeits, a perception of me, is a sense of our own power.
we can do something like this.
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond hard times.
maybe we can see widrigkeits as change.
widrigkeits are for change that we haven't adapted yet.
i think the biggest damage we have to feel ourselves is that we should be normal.
even honestly, who is normal?
there's no normal.
there's the usual. the typical, but not the normal, and would you really want to know that poor, gray person, if they really wanted to know?
i don't think so.
it would be great if we could have this paradigm of normality against another of possibilities or stronger, to even engage it a little bit more dangerous, so we can release the forces of very many children, and to put them in a very special and valuable skills in society.
anthropolls have found that we have always taken people from the members of our society: to be useful and to afford a contribution.
there's evidence that the neanderthals have been about 60, 000 years ago, older people and people with heavy physical injuries, and maybe that's because the life experience of these people were valuable for society.
they didn't look at these people as broken and useful; they were treated as something special and valuable.
a few years ago, i went to the city where i grew up, in a food market in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania, and i was standing there before a nice tomato.
it was summer, and i had shorts.
" and i hear a guy behind me, " " well, if that's not aimee mullins. " " "
and i turn around and see this older man. i had no idea who he is.
" and i said, " " sorry, sir, we know? i can't remember them. " " "
" and he said, " " well, you couldn't remember me. "
" when i saw her for the first time, i got her out of her mother's belly. " " "
oh, so.
and of course, it made clicks.
this was dr. kean, a man that i knew from telling my mom about this day, because of course, i became a typical, to my birthday two weeks.
the doctor for pranatale diagnostic my mother was in vacation, so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all.
and because i was born without wadenbeine, and my feet had been born after them, and i only had some toes on this, and a few toes at the other, he was the overbringing, this stranger had to kill the bad news.
" and he said to me, " " i had to say your parents you'd never walked, and you'd never have to be astonishing as other kids or that you could never lead an independent life, and they've just been just thought of me. " " "
in fact, i found that he collected newspapers of my entire childhood, whether i had won with a letter competition in the second grade, whether i was in the pfadfinders at the parade to halloween, whether i had my scholarship or one of my sport sieges, and he used this clip to
and he called this part of his course the x factor, the potential of the human will.
you can't emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being.
" and dr. kean went on, he said, " " i've learned that kids, if they didn't get something else, and even if they get a little support, when you're overestimated kids, children can achieve a lot. " " "
see, dr. kean changed his thinking.
he understood that the medical diagnosis, and how somebody deal with that are two different things.
and i also changed my thinking over time when they asked me about 15 years old, whether i'd been shattered my prosthetics against meat and bone, i didn't have a second.
i really wanted to get normal at that time.
if you ask me this today, i'm not so sure.
and that's because i've experienced something with my legs and not yet this experience.
and maybe that change could happen, because i'm so many people who opened me door instead of looking at people who wanted to constraints me or want to translate an idea.
you see, it really takes just a human demonstizing them how to manifest their forces, and they're through.
if you enable someone to activate its own internal forces, the human mind is so embarrassing--if you do that, and for somebody in a critical moment, you're a very good teacher.
they teach them to open yourself.
" the real meaning of the word" " educate" " worm in the word" " educate. " " "
it means to produce something that in one is the potential of it.
again, what potential do we want to call it?
in the' 60s, in the u. k. , a paradigm was done in the u. k. , and then gymnasies were released in total schools.
" they call this" " streaming trials" " in the u. s. we call this as" " tracking. " " "
students are going to be made by notes.
and the a student is getting more harder, getting better teachers and so on.
" they then have given a three-month period of time with a" " good" " note" " very well, " " and they said, " " they'd be very smart, and they'd be written for those three months. "
and of course, it's to hear you hear the heart that reverses the lone students, they're only sufficient.
and then it was just after three months.
but only those who were still in school--except for the students who had missing school.
it was very crucial about this study that the teachers weren't used.
the teacher didn't know that something was changed.
they were just told that they're the one-student student, and that are the students with the note, and they've taught them something, and they've been treated.
the only really disability is a mind that has been broken, has no hope more. he doesn't find anything more. he lacks our natural, child curiosity, and our innovators of imagination.
but if we create it to support the human minds, continue to continue to hope and find themselves and other people around it, to be curious and honesty, we actually put our forces really positive.
if a mind prevents about these qualities, we can create a new reality and new movement.
" i want to end with a poem that was verfasstd by a persian poet named hafiz at 14. " " and i told my friend jacques of thebois, and the poem is called" " the god who knows only four words, not the god of the name, not the god who
come on, dance with me. thank you.
