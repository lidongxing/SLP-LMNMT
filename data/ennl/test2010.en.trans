a few years ago, peter skillman here, at ted, has shown a design game.
the marshmallow challenge.
and the idea is quite simple: four groups of four have to make a very high building building building with 20 pieces of spaghetti, a meter tape, a meter of rope and a marshmallow.
the marshmallow needs to be on top of it.
and, although it sounds simple, it turns out it's quite hard, because this assignment is actually forcing people to work very quickly together.
and because i found this an interesting idea, i decided to take it into a design workshop.
and it was a big success.
since then, i've done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with students, designers and architects, and even fortune 50 companies.
and this exercise gives us deep insights in how people work together, and i want to share some of them with you.
normally, the first step is that people prepare for the cause.
they talk about it, imagine what it looks like, play power games.
and then they're going to plan, organize.
they're sketches and they're monteing spaghetti.
most of the time, they build bigger building builders of spaghetti.
and at the end, when the time is almost grazing the marshmallow, they put it carefully on it, do a step back and. . . tadaa!
they admire their work.
" but what's really going on, usually, is that the" " tadaa" " is changing in a" " oh oh, " " because the weight of the marshmallow lets the whole buildingwork and collapse. "
some people have more of those oh oh moments than others.
what of the worst ones have just gone down with an mba.
they lie, they're playing false, they're distracted, and they're making pretty stupid building.
" and then, of course, there are teams that make a lot more" " tadaa" " building. "
and at the best underneath them, they're just wasted kindergarten.
it's impressive.
and peter tells us that they're not just making the highest building systems even though they're the most interesting ones.
so what you're wondering now is, how can this be? why? what do the kindergarten?
" peters answer is, " " none of the children wastes time to be the boss of the spaghetti bv. " " right. "
they don't waste time with power games.
but there's another reason.
and that is that economists are trained to find the only right solution.
and then they're going to perform those.
but what happens, when they put the marshmallow on top of it, is that they don't have time anymore.
it's a disaster.
sounds familiar, especially?
what kindergarten do differently.
is that they start with the marshmallow.
they build prototypes, and new prototypes,
increasingly with the marshmallow top, so they have more opportunities to repair bad prototypes.
designers recognize this form of collaboration as the basis of an iterative process.
and in every version, the kids get immediately feedback about what and what doesn't work.
so building prototypes is very important.
but let's see how different teams do it.
the average for most people is about 50 inches.
economists get half of that, lawyers do something, but not much better.
kindergarten, better than most adults.
who does it best?
architects and engineers, happy.
the highest construction work i've seen was a meter high.
and why? because they understand triangles, and self-organizing geometry structures are key to building stable building builders.
ceos, something better than average.
but now it's interesting: if you put a secretary in the team, they're better.
" incredible. you see the team and you think, " " they're going to win. " " "
you can see that before. and why?
because they're good at it to support.
they manage, understand the process.
and every team that's good misunderstood and pay attention to work will be the performance of that team.
specialized and support skills lead together to a success.
if you're normally spoken 10 teams, this is what you're going to do about six, they're going to have a standworkwork.
and i tried something interesting.
i thought, we're making it a little more exciting.
so, i opened 10, 000 dollars to software to winning team.
and what do you think these designs students did?
what happened?
the next thing.
no team had a standing constructionwork.
a tower from, for example, a centimeter, had been enough to win at all.
what's interesting is that a higher income has big consequences.
we've repeated the exercise with the same students.
and what do you think happened then?
so now they understand the use of prototypes.
and this team changed from the worst team in one of the best.
they made the highest building building in the least time.
so that's a good lesson for us about the nature of rewards and success.
you might wonder, why would anyone want to spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?
the reason is, i work with digital tools and processes to help teams build cars, video games and visual effects.
and the marshmallow challenge helps them get behind the hidden assumption.
because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow, right?
the challenge offers a shared experience, a common language, a common institution to make the best prototype.
so that's the value of the experience of this so simple exercise.
and who's interested, go to marshmallowchallenge. com.
in this blog, you can see how to build the mashmallows.
there's step--step--for stapinstructions.
there are examples of how people have invented tricks all over the world and adaptations.
there's also global record.
and the fundamental lesson is, i think, that design is really a contactsport.
it takes the revenue of all of our senses, and that we think we feel best, and we use performance to the challenge that we have for us.
" and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is already enough to change" " oh oh" " moment in a" " tadaa" " moment. "
and it makes a big difference.
thank you very much.
let's assume a little bit about a machine, a big machine, a cool ted-like machine, and it's another time machine.
and everybody here needs to be here.
you can go back in time or forward in time, but not here and now.
i'm curious what you'd choose, because i've already asked this question to a lot of friends, and they all want to go back.
they all want to go back to time before cars or twitter or american idol.
i don't know.
and i'm convinced that there's a certain hang to nostalgia, there's a way to wishes.
and i can get there.
but i don't hear that, i have to say.
i don't want to go back, and not because i'm so empowered, but for the opportunity of this planet.
they're not going to move forward.
so i also want to be in the machine, and i want to move forward.
we live in the most amazing time on this planet in whatever area you want health, wealth, mobility, opportunities, reducing diseases.
never had a time like this.
my overgrootouders all died around the 60.
my grandparents took all the 70.
and my parents are already at 80.
so i can hope to get a lot in the 90.
but it's not even about us.
there's a lot more on the game.
a child that's born in new delhi today has a life expectancy equal to the richest man in the world 100 years.
think about that. that's an incredible fact.
and why is that true?
smallpox. smallpox have taken billions of people on this planet of life.
they had a impact on the demographics of this world larger than any war.
but they don't exist anymore. they're gone.
we have overwhelmed. poef!
in the richest world, diseases, who threatened millions of people a generation ago, as good as not.
difterie, redhond, child flu. . .
anybody here knows what that was?
inquiry, modern medicine our ability to provide billions of food, are all triumph of the scientific method.
and for me, the scientific method, preparing things, see if it's working, and it's going to leave it if it doesn' t, one of the greatest yields of humanity.
that's the good news.
but unfortunately, that's the only good news, because there's some other problems, they've been a lot of them, and one of them is that, despite all of our things, there's a billion people hungry to bed in this world every single day.
their number takes, and it takes quickly, and that's a shame.
and not only that, we've also used our imagination to pollinate this world.
drinkable water, agriculture, rainforests, oil, gas: they're disappearing, and quickly, and if we're not able to be able to work by destroying innovation from this misery, we will disappear.
so the question is, can we do that? i think it' s.
and i think it's clear that we're able to take care of food for billions without making the country that we live out.
i think we can provide this world of energy forms that don't help him in the destruction.
i really believe that, and no, that's not a wish.
but now that's what i woke up at night--one of the things i woke up at night.
never before we depend on scientific progress, never, and never have been able to use it as we can today.
we're on the threshold of the most amazing progress in all sorts of area.
and yet, i really think that we have hundreds of years, say, 300 years, have to go back to the time of the enlightenment, to find a time that we've been able to do so progress, that we've been able to do these innovations more heartly and more areas
people are hanging out their faiths with such a heart attack that it's almost almost impossible to liberate them.
and listen, everybody's got right on their own opinion; everyone has even the right to a sense of what progress is, but you know where you don't have straight?
you have no right to your own facts. no, you don't have that.
and i've done a little while to realize that.
" a dozen years ago, i wrote a story about income for" " the new yorker, " " a short story. "
i was amazed to find out, by what was the most effective measure for public health in history.
i didn't know what to do, so i wrote just a story about it and went on.
a little bit later, i wrote a story about genetically manipulated food.
again, the same thing, but worse this time.
people were crazy.
" so i also wrote a story about that, and i couldn't understand why people found this" " frankenvoedsel, " " why they thought that manipulating molecules' molecules, rather than a coincidence, rather than a coincidence against nature. "
but, you know, i do what i do. i wrote a story, and i went to the order of the day. and i'm a journalist. we typed it, we serve it, we're eating, and that's that.
but these stories kept going on, i couldn't make sure why, but eventually.
and it's because those fanatics that made me crazy, in fact, were not fanatics at all.
they were wired, they were good entrepreneurial, decent.
just like the people in this room.
and it was just that what was so stuck with me like that.
but then i thought, you know, let's be equally honest: we've come to a moment in this world where we don't have the same ratio for progress as well.
we talk about it twice.
we're talking ironically about it as between the destiny.
" " " progress. " " "
ok, there are reasons, and i also think we know them.
we're lost belief in institutions, in authority, and we're lost in science itself, and there's no reason why not.
you just have to drop some names and understand people.
chernobyl, bhopal, the challenger, vioxx, mass destruction, not good punishing punch cards.
i mean, you can put your list together.
there are questions and problems with those people that we thought they always had equal.
so be skeptical.
ask questions, demand and evidence, don't take anything.
but here's the thing: if you get evidence, then you have to hire them, and we don't do so well.
and the reason i can say that is that we're now living in an unprecedented fear ofpidemia, and that we hope that they're going to be able to get away as quickly.
about 12 years ago, a horrible story was published, that was a relationship between autism epidemic and the vaccine against measles, angry and redhond.
terrifying.
hopefully studies were done to go after whether this was true.
and it had to do that; it was a serious thing.
the data came out.
they were found in the united states, in england, in sweden, in canada, and the same result, not least, not least.
but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes, we believe what we see and what we think we think, what we really feel.
we can't believe a lot of papers of an official government projection that provides us from data, and i can come into that, and i think we can all do that.
but you know what?
the consequences were disasterful, disasterful, and it's about this fact: the united states are one of the few countries in the world where the number of conflicts against the measles are down.
that's a shame, and we should be ashamed.
it's terrible.
what's happening to us is that we could decide there?
now, i understand it. i understand it.
who's going to get me here?
did anybody ever see somebody die of measles?
it's not a lot.
and it didn't happen at all, but it happened 160, 000 times in the world last year.
that's a lot of killing by measles, 20 an hour.
but because it doesn't happen anymore anymore, and people like jenny mccarthy are coming away from fear and ignorance to spread in out of thousands as oprah and larry king live.
and they can do that because they can't make any distinction between causes and coincidental together of circumstances.
they don't understand that these things seem the same, but the practical never really are.
and that's something we need to learn, and we need to learn quickly.
this guy was a hero, jonas salk.
he liberated us from one of our worsts.
no fear, no more death rate. polio, poef!
that guy in the middle there, even though.
he's called paul offit.
he developed a vaccine against the rotavirus with some other people.
it saved the lives of about 400, 000 to 500, 000 children in the developing world.
all right, right?
well, it's good, except that paul goes around forgive vaccines and how valuable they are.
and that people should stop it to jammeren.
and he says it too.
so paul is a terrorist.
and if he's giving a public speech, it can only be in the company of body.
and he's getting phone calls at home because there are people who ask price to say they know where his children's school.
and why? because paul has developed a vaccine.
i don't have to say it, but vaccines are irresponsible.
take them away, and the diseases will come back, terrible diseases, and that's what's happening now.
we have back in this country.
and it's even worse, soon, children will die again when there's enough disease going on.
and they will not only die of meals.
what about polio? that too. why not?
a former fellow students wrote me back a couple of weeks, and said she found me a little bit more accurately.
nobody has told me that.
she didn't leave her child against polio.
in no case.
all right.
why? because we don't have polio anymore. and you know what?
yesterday, polio didn't come here anymore.
but who knows, maybe somebody on a plane in lagos, and he flies to los angels, it's now above ohio.
and within a few hours, he landed a car, and he comes to long beach, where he goes to one of these fantastic ted dinners.
and he doesn't realize that he's infected with a paralyzing disease, and we don't know because that's what it goes.
that's the planet that we live. it doesn't help make a lie-wandering.
we prefer to get into lies. we love it.
has everybody's morning decided his vital pressure?
echinacea, a little bit of antioxidant to go through the day?
i know because half of americans do it every day.
they harvest it, and they use alternative drugs, and it doesn't matter how often we discover that they are worthless.
and the data always point it out again.
they make your urine darker. and practically never more than that.
ok, if you want to spend 28 billion dollars for darker urine, it's okay.
dark urine. dark.
why do we do that? why do we do that? i think i understand it, we hate big pharma.
we hate the government. we rely on politicalrs.
it's got to be. our health supplies are disbberd.
they're for millions of our allies.
they're amazing heartless and disturbing even for those of us that they can permit.
so we walk away from it, and where are we walking?
we jump into the poor of big placebo.
it's great. i love big placebo.
but, you know, this is very, very, very, very, very, very messy, and we spend billions of dollars out of it.
i brought some of those things here.
ginkgo, deception, echinacea, deception, acai, i don't even know what that is, but we spend billions of dollars out of it, all deception.
" and you know what? if i tell this? if i start to call the people against me, and they say, " " what can you care? let's do people. "
" they feel good at it. " " "
and you know what? you're wrong.
" because it can't care if it's the secretary of health service saying, " " hm, i'm not going to give you a consequence of what my experts tell you about mammography. " " "
or the one or another can be steepingzalver who wants to treat his patients with coffee lines.
if you start replacing evidence and science by belief and magic you end up with what you didn't want to come from.
then you get into the south africa of thabo mbeki.
he's responsible for the death of 400, 000 of his people's death by saying that rooted, squirrel and lemon oil were more effective than the antiviral resources that can slow down aids.
hundreds of thousands of nodeless deaths in a country that has already lived over elsewhere by this disease.
don't tell me that these things don't have any consequences.
they've got them. they've always got them.
now, the most thoughtless epidemic in which we are now is the absurd struggle between prescription of genetically engineered food and the organic elite.
it's a idiot debate. it's got to stop.
it's about words, metaphors.
it's ideology, it's not science.
everything that we eat, every grain of rice, every bark of peterselie, every brussels spruit, has changed by man.
" remember, in the" " earth paradise" " there were no mandarin particles. "
there was no watermeloen.
even no christmas trees. they all come from us.
we created them over the course of the last 11, 000 years.
some of those products stayed and others didn' t.
we devised what we didn't do.
now we can do the same thing in a more targeted way.
and, sure, there are risks connected.
but we can produce vitamin a, which allows millions of healthier to live and live longer.
you don't want to touch that?
i have to say that i don't understand that.
we don't want genetically modified food.
and why?
well, you hear this all the time: you hear a lot of chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don't want huge fields with the same crop, wrong.
we don't like companies that patents on living things.
we don't want companies to have the property rights on seeds.
and you know what i answered?
you're right. let's do something about it.
it's true. our food problem is overwhelmed, but that's not science.
it doesn't have anywhere in science.
this is about laws, morality, patents.
science is not society.
no country.
even no idea; it's a process.
it's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes not.
but the idea that we have to fulfill the science to do her work because we fear it works really paralyzed and will increase millions of people to get any welfare.
you know, over the next 50 years, we will need more food than today.
70 percent.
this graph represents the investment in africa for the last 30 years.
shame. shame.
they really need it, and we remember it.
and the reason? genetically manipulated food.
we don't want people to be less food as cassave, for example.
cassava is the everyday food of a half billion people; it looks like potatoes.
it's just a lot of calories. it's worthless.
it contains no nutrients like proteins, scientists are doing something about doing that.
so that people can eat without being blind.
they wouldn't starve anymore, and you know what?
that would be nice. it wouldn't be a regular cuisine, but it would be fine.
and all i have to say is this: why are weteging?
i mean, let's ask that, why are weteging?
because we don't want to shed genes?
this is about doing genes. nothing to do with chemicals.
not with our ridiculous passion for hormones, our desire for more, better and more special food.
it's not about rice krispies, it's about keeping people alive.
and the point is that we're beginning to understand what that means.
because, you know what?
if we don't do it, and we go on, we're guilty of something we don't want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism.
i don't find any other way to describe this better.
it's selfish and ugly, our unlikely, and we really need to do something about it.
" so after this unimaginable expansion, you might want to say, " " you still want to travel this ridiculous time machine forward? " " "
absolutely. certainly, i want to.
now they're stuck in present, but we have an amazing opportunity.
we can do that time machine for everything we want to use.
we can bring them to a future that we want, and we're going to bring them to where we want ourselves.
we have to go on with these collapses, and we have to keep thinking, but if we go forward and move forward, we will be happy that we've done it.
i know we can do it, and that is, for what brings me, something that the world has to know.
thank you.
thank you.
a columnist of the los angeles times. . .
steve lopez, walking on one day. . .
by the center of los angeles,
when he heard wonderful music.
it came from a man.
a black man.
charming, walking, homeless.
he played a violin with just two strings.
i'm telling you something that many of you know already. . .
because the columns of steve formed the basis. . .
for a book whose film was made.
robert downey jr. play the role of steve lopez. . .
and jamie foxx who's from nathaniel anthony ayers. . .
the classroom schooled contrabassist.
they've got to break down a lot of promising career.
because he was suffering on paranoid schizophrenia.
nathaniel stopped the juilliardconsererts, plummeted in. . .
and 30 years later, he was homeless, 30 years later.
through the poorest streets of los angeles.
you should read steve's book or see the film.
not just for the wonderful band,
which came between these two men.
but also to see which role playing music,
an instrumental role, if i can say that that way. . .
to get nathaniel from the street.
i met ayers in 2008,
two years ago, in a disney concert hall.
he'd listened to an execution of the 1e and 4e symphony of beethoven. . .
and backstage came, and he suggested.
he was talking to a jovial and social way.
yo-yo-ma and hillary clinton.
he said the dodgers would never get the world series.
all of them move from a tough violinpassage.
in the last part of the fourth symphony of beethoven.
we talked about music. later, i got a email from steve. . .
that wrote that nathaniel would like to have a violin of me.
you need to know that nathaniel doesn't want to be treated.
when he was treated, he got shocktherap.
chlorpromazte and handclosure,
and that has drawn him for his life.
the result is he now. . .
attack from schizophrenia.
during the worst attacks,
exploded him. . .
and he disappeared days.
he's floated over the streets.
and living with that narigheid and the mustache in his head. . .
it's going to be a big deal.
nathaniel had been in such a clue,
when we started our first class.
he had a manic glow in his eyes.
he was lost.
he talked about. . .
invisible demons and smoke. . .
and somebody who wanted to poisoned him in a sleep.
i was scared.
not for myself, i was scared.
that i would lose him. . .
that he would take away in such an attack.
and that i would disrupt his relationship with the violin,
when i started talking about toners,
and arpeggios and other exciting examples. . .
from what you learn to vioollees.
so i started playing.
i played the first part of the violin economy of beethoven.
as i played,
i saw a clear change.
in the eyes of nathaniel.
it was like a invisible drug did his work.
it's a chemical reaction for which my game.
the catalyst was.
the manic excitement of nathaniel.
changed in understanding.
in quiet curiosity and grace.
as a miracle, he took his own violin.
and started playing on hearing.
some fragments of vioolc pockets,
that i had to get off. mendelssohn.
tchaikovsy, sibelius.
we started talking about music, from bach. . .
to beethoven and brahms. . .
bruckner, all bs.
from bartok to aan esa-pekka salonen.
i saw that not only he did.
a encyclopedia of musical knowledge had. . .
but he was personalized by that music.
he talked about it with the same passion,
and the same notion when i and my colleagues,
from the los angeles philharmonic.
by making music and talking about music. . .
was this guy changed.
from the paranoid, confused man. . .
those directly from the streets,
from los angeles had come.
in a charming, erudied,
brilliant, classroom-educated musicians.
music cure. music is changing us.
for naturalhaniel music is a healthy mind.
it can be thoughtful by music.
and delusies distorted,
through his fantasy and creativity,
in reality.
that's how he unlocks.
they're trusted attacks.
i saw that that's the essence of art.
that's why we make music.
that we take something that's in all of us.
deep in our core.
our emotions.
and that's what we're doing through our artistic lens.
through our cratiols that emotions can distort to reality.
the reality of that expression,
all of us.
we get hit, inspired and united.
nathaniel. . .
got a group of friends back.
the rescue power of music brought him back.
in a family of musici,
they understood him. . .
they're acknowledged talents.
and they respect him.
i'll always make music with nathaniel.
whether it's disney concert hall now. . .
or on the street. he reminds me of it.
why i've become musicus.
thank you.
thank you. thank you.
robert gupta.
i want to play something that i've stolen shame of cellists.
forgive me.
i'm jane mcgonigal. i'm a game designer.
for 10 years, i've been making online games.
and my goal for next decade is to make it easy to save the world in real life as it is in games.
now, i have a plan for this, and that plan is to convince more people, all of you, to convince more time to play larger and better games.
right now, we're playing online games three billion hours a week.
" some of you probably think, " " that's a lot of time to play games. " " "
maybe too much time, since there are so many important problems in the real world that people have to solve.
but it turns out, according to my research at the institute of the future, that the opposite is true.
three billion hours a week is not enough to solve the world's urgent problems.
more than that, i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, that we need to increase that number.
i've calculated that we need in total 21 billion hours a week.
that's probably a strange idea, so i'll say it again, i'll let it go in.
if we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity, i believe that we have to try to play at least 21 billion hours of games against the end of next decade. no, i'm serious.
this is the reason. this picture sums quite well together why games are so important to the future survival of humanity. really.
this is a portrait through a photographer, phil toledano.
he wanted to receive the emotion of the game.
so he put a camera for gamers while they played.
and this is an classic emotion in the game.
now, if you're not a gamer, you're probably going to miss some nuances in this picture.
you probably see the sense of pressure, a little fear, but also intense concentration, a deep focus to solve a very difficult problem.
if you're a gamer, you'll find a few nuances here: the cracks around the eyes and mouth is a sign of optimism.
the eyebrows up above are a sign of surprise.
this is a gamer that's on the point of something called a epic win.
ah, you know that. okay, good.
so we have a few gamers here.
a epic win is a outcome that is so incredibly positive that you didn't know it was possible until you achieved it.
it was almost not to imagine.
and when you're there, you're surprised to discover what you can really. that's a epic win.
" this is a gamer to give you a" " epic win. " " "
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers around the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century.
the face of somebody who, against all expectations, is to understand a epic win.
but unfortunately, we think earlier this face in everyday life while we're trying to tackle problems.
" this is what i call" " i'm not good at life" " face. "
and this is me doing it actually. can you see it? yeah. good.
" this is me making it" " i'm not good at life" " face. "
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley, california, where i did my phd about why we're better in games than in real life.
and this is a problem that many gamers have.
we feel we're not as good at reality as we are in games.
and i mean not just successful, even though it's part of it.
we do achieve more in games. but i mean, i mean, with good motivated to do something that counts, inspired to work together.
and when we're in a game world, i believe that most of us become the best version of ourselves, the most likely to help quickly.
the most likely to stay as long as it's needed to be in a problem, to try to get a failure.
and when we're in real life, when we're facing a failure, when we're faced with obstacles, we often don't feel like that.
we feel overwhelmed. we feel overwhelmed.
we feel anxious, perhaps depressed, frustrated or cynical.
we never have those feelings when we play games.
they just don't exist in games.
so that's what i wanted to study when i was a student.
what part of games makes it impossible that we feel like we can't achieve anything?
how can we take those feelings of games and apply them to work in the real world?
so i watched games like word or warcraft, which is really the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems.
and i started to find some things that make epic profit in the online world.
the first thing i noticed is that every time you come into one of those online games, especially world of warcraft, there are very different characters that you like to have a world-saving mission, immediately.
but not just a mission, a mission that's perfectly adapted to your level in the game. right?
so, you can do it.
they never give you a challenge you don't address.
but it's on the extreme of your possibilities. so you have to try hard.
but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft.
you can't sit there somewhere.
there's always something specific and important that needs to be done.
and there are also very many contributions.
every place where you go, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help you spend your epicry mission.
that's something that we have difficult to do in real life, that feeling that within our reach, there are very many employees.
and also that there's a epic story, this inspiring story that tells us why we are here and what we do.
and then all the positive feedback we get.
you've heard of a level, plus--a force, and plus--a intelligence.
sun's feedback stream we don't get in real life.
when i walked out of this stage, i won't get a message from plus--speak, plus--a crazy idea, plus-20 crazy idea.
i don't get one of those feedback in real life.
now, the problem with collaborative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it's so empowered to stand all the time on a epic win's point, that we've decided to spend all of our time on a online games.
it's just better than reality.
so far, world of warcraft players, all along five, 93 million years, spend the virtual problems of azeroth.
now, that's not necessarily something.
it may sound bad.
to make that clear: 5.93 million years ago, our first human ancestors stood up.
that was the first, straight-up primate.
okay, so if we talk about the amount of time we're investing in games's games, the only way it has meaning to even think about it is by talking about time in the context of human evolution, which is extraordinary.
but it's also appropriate. because it turns out that we spend so much time with games's possible, we change the same thing as humans as humans.
we evolve to a species that is more cooperative and privilege.
this is true. i believe this.
so, think about this interesting number.
it was recently published by a carnegie mellon university researcher.
the average young person today, in a country with a major game culture, will have spent 10, 000 hours of game, against the time he's 21 years old.
now, 10, 000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
first of all, kids in the united states is 10, 080 hour, the exact amount of time you spend in school from the fifth-year-old years, until you send it off.
so we've got a similar orbit of education where young people learn a lot about the game as they do about all the rest in school.
some of you have probably read malcom gladwell's book's outliers.
so you've probably heard of his success theory, the 10, 000 hours of success theory.
it's on this wonderful, cognitive science research based that says that if we can control 10, 000 hours of useful study for the same thing that we become 21, we're becoming virtuoso.
we'll be as good at what we do as the best of the world.
and so, what we're seeing now is a whole generation of young people who are virtu points in the game.
" so, the big question is, " " what are gamers going to be so good at? " " "
because if we can get there, we would have a virtual supply supply of human potential.
this is the number of people who play around the world at least one hour a day of games.
these are our virtuozen.
500 million people who are extremely good at something.
and in the next decade, we'll have another billion gamers that are extraordinary in something.
if you don't know, this is coming.
the gaming industry is developing consoles that need little power that need little power, and with wireless phone networks rather than broadband internet so that gamers from all over the world, especially in india, china and brazil, online.
they expect a billion gamers against next decade.
that brings us to 1.5 billion gamers.
so i wondered where we're going to become such a virtuoso.
i found four things. the first one is burning optimism.
okay. you can see this as extreme self-motivation.
burning optimism is the will to act immediately, to address a barrier, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable opportunity on success.
gamers always believe that a epic win is possible, and it's always worth trying to try, and then try now.
gamers's not going to be.
gamers are virtuozen in taking a dense social dust.
there's a lot of interesting research that it turns out that we'd rather have people after we played a game with them, even though they've totally plugged us.
the reason is that you need trust to play with somebody a game.
we trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play the same rules, that they go behind the same goal, that they stay beyond the game.
so a game playing with somebody to promote the interconnections, the trust and the collaboration.
and as a result, we actually build stronger social relationships.
great productivity. great.
you know, there's a reason that the average world of warcraft is playing gamer 22 hours a week almost like a half-time profession.
and that's because we know that when we play a game, we're actually happier to work hard than if we're relaxed or somewhere.
we know that we're made as people to deliver hard, useful work.
and gamers are always prepared to work, if they're given the right job.
and ultimately, epic meaning.
gamers like to be broken on awe missions, to the stories of planetary scale.
so, a little bit of a little bit to make that clearer.
you all know wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
the second largest wiki in the world, almost 80, 000 articles, is the world of warcraft wiki.
five million people use it every month.
they've brought more info about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic treated by another wiki.
they build a epic story.
they build a epic source of knowledge about world of warcraft.
okay, so those are four superpowers that are combined to one thing.
gamers are super-empowered, hopeful individuals.
these are people who believe they are individually capable of changing the world.
and the only problem is that they believe they're able to change virtual worlds and not the real world.
that's the problem i'm trying to solve.
there's an economist, edward castronova.
his work is brilliant. he's looking for why people spend so much time and energy and money online worlds.
" and he says, " " we've got nothing less than a real mass of exodus to virtual worlds and online game worlds. " " "
and he's an economist, so it's rational.
and he says, not like me, i'm a game designer; i'm left.
but he says that this is completely logical, because gamers can achieve more in a online world than in real life.
they can have stronger social relationships in games than in real life.
they get better feedback, and they feel more rewarded in games than in real life.
so he says that it's now perfectly logical that gamers spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world.
now, i'm also going to think that that's rational right now.
but it's not a optimal situation at all.
we need to look at the real world more like a game.
so i take my inspiration of something 2, 500 years ago.
these are ancient dices, made out of sheep forces. okay?
before we had cool controllers, we had sheep test stores.
and this allows the first piece of tools for that to play, designed by people.
and if you know the working of the ancient greek historian herodotus, you might know this story.
the inventors of the first game and why they invented it.
herodotus says that games, especially those with dices, were invented in the kingdom of lyck for a famine.
apparently, the famine was so bad that the king of lydie decided to do anything.
people were breaking. people fought.
it was a extreme situation. they had to find a extreme solution.
so herodotus says, they found out dobble and put a state policy.
one day, you eat everyone.
the next day, everybody plays games.
and they would be so interrupted in their play, because they're so exciting, and stupid us in such a great productivity, that they wouldn't ignore the fact that they wouldn't ignore.
the next day, they played games.
the day after that, they ate.
and according to herodotus, they were full of this 18 years.
they survived a famine by eating one day and play the next day.
now, this is exactly how we use games today.
we use games to escape the real world suffering.
we use them to escape everything that's broken in the real world, everything that's not satisfied to the real life, and we get what we need from games.
but it doesn't have to end.
this is very exciting.
after 18 years of herodot, the famine was not better.
so the king decided they would play another last dice.
they shared the whole kingdom in two.
they played a dice game, and the winners of that game was allowed to be on a epicry adventure.
they would leave lydie, and they're looking for a new hometown.
and just enough people kept about survival of the lives that were still there, and hopefully they could get the civilization somewhere else.
now, this sounds crazy, right?
but recently, dna proves that the ethics, which would lead to the roman rich, have the same dna as the old lydiers.
and so scientists have suggested that herodotus's crazy story is true.
and geologists have found evidence of climate change that took almost 20 years to explain the famine.
so this crazy story might be true.
it could be that they saved their culture by playing games, by escapeing to a game for 18 years, and then to be so inspired, and so many of them were able to come together with games, that they save their whole civilization in that way.
okay, we can.
we play warcraft since 1994.
it was the first real-time strategy game of the warcraft series. it was 16 years ago.
they played with dobbles for 18 years, we play warcraft for 16 years.
i say we're ready for our own epic game.
now, they let half the population search for a new world.
so that's where i'm going to take my 21 billion hours a week.
we let half of our chords to game one hour a day until we solve problems in the real world.
" now, i know what you're wondering, " " how will we solve those problems by game? " " well, that's what i've been working on for the last few years, on the institution for the future. "
we have a banner in our building in palo alto, and it expresses our point of view of how to deal with the future.
we don't want to predict him.
we want to form it.
we want to imagine the best possible outcome.
and then we want to give people the power to make the future reality.
" we want to introduce our" " epic wins, " " and then people give the resources to understand their" " epic win. " " "
i'll show you briefly briefly three games that i've made that attempt to give people the resources to create their own epic profit in the future.
okay, this is world without oil.
we made this game in 2007.
this is a online game where you try to survive a shortage of oil.
it's fictional, but we put enough online content in it to make you believe that it's real, and to let you live your real life as if we don't have oil anymore. so, if you start the game, you're telling us where you live.
and then we give you real-time news images and data feeds that show you what the exact price of oil is, which is not available, how the food supply is affected, how transportation is affected, or the schools are closed, or there are riots.
and you have to figure out how to live your real life as though this was true. and then we ask you to start a blog about it to post videos and photos.
we started this game with 1, 700 players in 2007.
and we followed them for three years since.
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
nobody wants to change its lifespans just because it's good for the world or because we should.
" but if you put them in a epic adventure, and she says, " " we don't have oil anymore. " " "
this is a great story and adventure to go up.
and then you challenge yourself to see how you survive.
most players kept their habits that they were offered in this game.
so, for the next world-saving game, we decided to get higher, bigger problems than a oil shortage.
we made a game called superstruct at the institute for the future.
all of a sudden, a supercomputer had calculated that people had only 23 years on earth.
this supercomputer, of course, had the name global extinction awareness system.
we asked people to get online, almost like a jerry bruckheimer film.
you know, jerry bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team.
you have the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-prisoner, and they have to save the world.
but in our game, instead of taking five people on the dream team, we put everyone on the dream team, and it's your job to find the future of energy, the future of nutrition, the future of health, the future of security and the future of social change.
we had 8, 000 people playing play for eight weeks.
" they take 500 huge creative solutions that you can see if you look at google" " superstruct. " " "
and then finally, the last game, we spend it on three marchs. this game is made in collaboration with the world bank institute.
if you're showing the game, you'll be certified by the world bank institute as a social innovation, class of 2010.
working with universities all over black africa, and we invite them to learn social innovation skills.
we have a cartoon story. we have a system of levels in skills like local insight, knowledge, sustainability, vision and resource kingdom.
i'd like to invite all of you to share this game please with young people, all around the world, especially in development zones, that might be able to get advantage of their own social enterprises to save the world.
so i'm going to show you now.
i want to ask a question.
what do you think, is there's going to happen now?
we have all these amazing gamers, we have these games that are ideas of what we might do, but none of them saved the real world.
well, i hope you're choosing with me, that gamers are a human resource, which we can use to help the real world, that games are a powerful platform for change.
we have all these incredible superpowers, salmon productivity, the ability to have a dense, social dust, this sense of burning optimism and desire to a epic meaning.
i really hope we can come together to play games that make a difference, to survive on this planet one century.
and my hope is that you're going to join me and make games like this.
if i look forward to the next decade, i know two things that we can make, that we can form every future that we can imagine and play every game that we want.
so, i say, let's start the world-changing play.
thank you.
since any time, i've been interested in the placebo effect.
" that may seem strange to a magician unless you recognize the same meaning as i do, that' s" " something that's fake, so it's strong by somebody's believed. " " in other words, sugar pills have a measure effect in certain studies: the placebo effect
just because the person in question thinks that what's going on is a medical tool or something else.
for example, in order for pain, for example, if you believe somewhere in a way, it's a measure of physical effective, the placebo effect.
something that's fake is really, because of somebody's perception of it.
to make sure that we understand each other, i want to start showing you a very simple baseife.
and i'm going to show you how it works. this trick is certainly ever since the 1950s in every magic trick for children.
i learned him as a little boy at the scouting in the 1970s.
i'll do the trick, then i'll explain him.
and then i explain why i explain him.
this is what happens.
the knife, you can see; my hand, that you can see.
i'm going to hold the knife in this way in my hand.
i'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit.
and to make sure that there's nothing in or out of my sleeve, i'll squeeze here in my wrist.
so you can see that there's no movement possible.
that's how long i squeeze here, nothing can come in and come out of my cell.
the goal is very simple.
i'll open my hand and hopefully, if it's good, my magneticism will hold the knife on its place.
the knife is even so sad, that i can shake it, and that the knife doesn't fall on the ground.
nothing comes in or from my sleeve, no deception. and you can observe everything accurately.
ta-da!
this trick often taught me to young kids who are interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about deception by studying it.
even though the trick is very simple.
probably many of you know this trick.
this is what happens.
i love the knife in my hand.
i say i'm stuck my wrist, to make sure that there's nothing in and from my sleeve.
that's gone.
the reason i hold my wrist is because it's the secret of the illusion.
at the moment that my hand moves away from you, my wisdom of his original place shift to one where he's been trained.
" " " nice trick. " " somebody who has no youth is in the room. "
that's how it goes.
and when i turn around, my finger shifts.
we can talk about why this is misleading, why you don't notice that there are three fingers visible here.
that's because the brain processed information in a way in which it doesn't do one, two, three counts, but group.
but it's not really about that, right? and then i open my hand.
of course, the mes doesn't hang out of magneticism, but by deception, by the presence of my wisdom.
and when i close my hand, the same thing.
and when i turn back to the weather, this movement will make sure i can distribute my finger.
i get this hand away. you reach the knife.
a nice trick you can do for friends and family. thank you.
now, what does this have to do with the placebo effect?
about a year ago, i read a study that completely opened me.
i'm not a scientist, so for me, this was amazing.
it turns out that if you give a placebo in the form of a white round pill that looks like a aspirin, it has a certain measure effect.
make the shape of the placebo changes, for example, by making a smaller pill, which you color blue, and then you put it on a letter, the placebo becomes more effective.
despite that none of both adaptations have medicinal meaning--they're sugar pills.
but a white pill is not as good as a blue one.
what? i really got there from upside down.
but it turns out, it can wake up.
it turns out that capsules are even more effective than any kind of tablets.
a colored capsule, yellow on one and red on the other side is better than a white.
dosering plays a role.
a pill is not as good as three pills--i can't remember the statistics, sorry.
but the point is. . .
doses play a role.
and the form plays a role.
and for the ultimate placebo effect, we need to go to the needle.
yes, right? a injection puzzle with a little bit--a few pennies of a kind that you inject in a patient. . .
this is a huge powerful picture in its mind.
it's many times stronger than the white pill.
we show another graph next time, when we can show slides.
the point is, the white pill is not as good as the blue, is not as good as the capsule, is not as good as the needle.
and none of all has a real medicinal trait.
only you believe it really makes it in your body and creates a stronger effect.
i wanted to see if i could apply that idea into a trick.
i wanted to take something clear that's a trick, and it really relates.
we know that research that if you want reality, you need to grab the needle.
this is a needle of nearly 18 centimeters. it's called vlijcherp.
i'm going to take her a little sterilizing here.
this is really my meat. this is not a special crazy meat.
this is my skin. this is not an hollywoord special effect.
i'm going to drive my skin, and i'm going to cross this needle through my arm, until i'm running through it.
if you're over-sensitive--or if you're easily whistled. . . i did these tricks yesterday for some friends and some people i didn't know.
a woman almost went from her sticks.
so i imagine that if you're over-sensitive, that you're the next 30--you know what, i do the first heavy part of it.
you can look, but also look away when you want.
this is what happens.
at the bottom of my arm, i'm going to make a little hole.
sorry, man. do you find this easy?
and then a little bit through my skin, and then the other side goes out.
now, in essence, we're in the same situation as with the fertilizer.
it's sort of like this.
but you can count my fingers now, right?
i'll show them. here's one, two, three, four, five.
yeah.
i know people think when they see this.
" they're thinking, " " he's certainly not stupid enough to drive themselves for a few minutes of entertainment of his audience. " " let me give you a little bit. "
what does that look like? pretty good.
" yes, i know. the people in the back of the room say, " " ok, i didn't really see that. " " people in the other room are getting closer to the screen. "
let me show you this from close.
that's really my skin. that's not hollywood special.
that's my meat. i can spin that pin.
sorry. if you get too much, look away and not to that thing.
" people in the back of the room or people later watching the images, say, " " that looks like a beautiful special effect, but if it was real, there's a hole there and there's one. if it really would be, it would be blood. " " let me make a little bit
yeah, there it is.
normally, i would now remove the needle.
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds.
but in this context and with the idea of taking something that is fake and making it real, let me just sit down the needle and drop it off the stage.
and over the next few days, i'm going to show you several times.
hopefully you're looking forward. thank you very much.
i've known a lot of fish in my life.
i've gone from just two.
the first thing that seemed more like passionately.
it was a beautiful fish, tasteful, good structure, readily, a best seller on the menu.
what a fish.
even better, it was raised fish to the assumptions of sustainability.
so you felt good at selling.
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months.
one day, the head of the company and asked me if i wanted to speak to a event on the sustainability of the kweker process.
" " " absolutely, " " i said. "
here was a company that was trying to solve something, that has become this unimaginable problem for our cooking.
how do we keep fish on our menu?
over the last 50 years, we've taken the seas as we cut forests.
it's hard to exaggerated the desert.
90 percent of the big fish that we love, the tunas, the heilbots, the salmon, swordfish, they're collapsed.
there's almost nothing left.
so, no matter how good it is, aquaculture, viskweus, is part of our future.
although there are many arguments against it.
fishing maps pollute, most of them are at least inefficient, take tuna.
it's a big minute.
it has a food version of 15 against 1.
what that means is that there's a five-pound wild fish needed to get a pound controlled tuna.
not very sustainable.
and it doesn't taste very well.
so this was finally a company that was trying to do well.
i wanted to support them.
the day before the event, i called the head pr of the company.
let's call him don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " to get the facts clear, you're familiar because of it so far in sea, you don't pollinate. " " "
" " " that's true, " " he said. " " we're so far from the coast, that the waste of our fish is spreading and not concentrate. " " "
" and he agreed, " " we're in fact a world. "
" that food version? 2.5 to one, " " he said, " " best in business. " " "
2.5 against 1, great.
" " " 2.5 against one wat? what do you feel? " " "
" " " sustainable proteins, " " he said. "
" " " great, " " i said. and i put the phone down. "
and that night, i was in bed, and i thought, well, what's a sustainable protein in god?
so the next day, right before the event i called don.
" i said, " " well, what are examples of sustainable proteins? " " "
he said he didn't know. he was going to ask.
so i've been on the line with some people in the company.
nobody could give me a clear answer.
until i finally got the main biologist at the line.
let's call him don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " what are some examples of sustainable proteins? " " "
all right, he called some algae and some fish pockets, and then he said chicken balls.
" i said, " " chicken balls? " " "
" he said, " " yes, united, skin, bone bones, scarce, dry and processed. " " "
" i said, " " what percentage of your food is chicken? " " "
thinking, ah, two percent.
" " " well, that's about 30 percent, " " he said. "
" and i said, " " well, what's sustainable about chicken to fish? " " "
" there was a long pause on the line, and he said, " " there's just too much chicken in the world. " " "
my love for this fish was about.
no, not because i'm a self-consuming, virtue of virtue.
that's me.
no, i lost my love for this fish because, i swear it, after that conversation, the fish tasted to chicken.
this second fish, which is a very different love story.
it's the romantic species, it's the species where as you know more of your fish, you like the fish.
i ate for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain.
a ferocious journalist talked about this fish for a long time.
she's got us a little bit more.
he came to the table, a bright, almost gleashing, white color.
the cook had cooked him too seriously.
almost twice too gaar.
it was amazing.
who can do a fish so well after he's cooked?
i don' t, but this guy does.
let's call him miguel.
in fact, his name is also miguel.
and no, he doesn't cook the fish, and he's not a cook.
at least not in the way that you and i understand.
he's a biologist in fata la palma.
that's a fishery in the southern spain of spain.
at the point of the gaudalquivirvir river.
until the' 80s, the kwekerij was the hands of argentina.
they shaved on what was actually drasland.
and they did that by cleaning the country.
they built a complex channels, and they pushed the water from the country in the river.
it didn't want to get them, not economic.
and ecologically, it was a disaster.
90 percent of the birds died.
what, for this place, is a lot of birds.
and so in 1982, an spanish environmental company bought the country.
what did they do?
they're running the flow around.
they're literally putting the button.
instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to get water back into it.
they put the channels underwater.
they created a 100 acres of big fishery--baars, harder, shrimp, shrimp, the shrimp, and at the same time, miguel and its company have completely returned the ecological desert.
it's great.
i mean, you've never seen anything like this.
you're looking at the horizon that's infinite far away, and you're seeing overflow channels and this thick, rich swamp.
not so long ago, i was there with miguel.
he's a great guy, three quarters of charles darwin and a quarter of crocodile dundee.
ok? that's what we're doing, we're walking through the draland, and i'm going to swept and sweating, mud to m' n knees, and miguel gives calm a biology class.
here he points to a rare black-shoulder forest.
now he points on the mineral need of the phytoplankton.
and here, here he sees a group of speech that he's doing on the tanzanian giraf.
it turns out that miguel has spent most of his career in the mikumi national park in africa.
i asked him how he's gotten such an n visexpert.
" he said, " " fish? i don't know about fish. "
" i'm a relationship expert. " " "
and then he talks so far beyond rare birds and algae and strange water plants.
don't get me wrong, it was really fascinating, a kind of biological community unplugged.
it was great, but i fell in love.
and my head was swidness at the breakfast piece of delightful fish that i had the night before.
" so i lowered him. i said, " " miguel, how does it taste your fish so well? " " "
he pointed to the algae.
" " " i know, guy, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships, it's great. "
but what are the fish eating?
" what is the foodconversieratio? " " "
and then he goes by telling me that it's such a rich system, that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild.
the biomass, the phytoplankton, the animal plankton, which is what the fish feed.
the system is so healthy, it's completely self-destructive.
there is no feeling.
have you ever heard of a farm that didn't feel her animals?
" later that day, i drove over this terrain with miguel and asked him, and i said, " " for a place that seems so natural, " " unlike any kwekerij i've ever been, " " how do you measure success? " " "
at that time, it was as if a filmregic was a set exchange.
and we went around and saw the most amazing face, thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, literally a pink carpet for so many you could see.
" " " that's success, " " he said. "
" " " look at their belly, pink. "
" they're party. " " "
party? i was totally confused.
" and i said, " " miguel, they're not party at your fish? " " "
" " " yes! " " he said. "
" " " we're losing 20 percent of our fish envelopes to birds. "
last year, this area had 600, 000 birds, more than 250 different species.
" it's now the biggest and one of the most important private bird flights in europe. " " "
" and i said, " " miguel, is a bird population that doesn't do the last thing you want on a fish agent? " " "
he shake his head, no.
" he said, " " we're extensive, not intense. "
this is an ecological network.
the flamingos eat the shrimp.
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
" so how rude the belly, the better the system. " " "
okay, let's just show you a little bit.
a kwekerij that doesn't feel his animals, and a kwekerij measure its success to the hunting of his hunters.
it's also a fishery, but it's also a bird flight.
oh, and by the way, that flamingos, who actually shouldn't be here at all.
they broches 250 kilometers away, where the soil conditions are better to build nests.
every morning they fly 250 kilometers to the kweker.
and every night they fly back 250 kilometers.
they do that because they can follow the entrepreneurial white line of the highway a92.
no joke.
i proposed a penguinmars, so i looked at miguel.
" and i said, " " miguel, they fly 250 kilometers to the kweker and then 250 kilometers back at night? "
" do they do that for the boy? " " "
he looked at me as though i was just quoting a whitney wood song.
" he said, " " no. they do that for food is better. " " "
i haven't mentioned the skin of my beloved fish that was great, and i don't like fishhuid.
i don't love it. i don't like krokant.
it's that wrange, teeard taste.
i rarely cook with it.
but when i tasted him in that restaurant in southern spain, he didn't taste at fishhuid at all.
he tasted sweet and cleaned you out of the ocean.
i said that against miguel, and he squeezed.
" he said, " " the skin works like a spouse. "
it's the last defense before something that goes into the body.
" he's evolved to suffer unrestrials. " " "
" and then he added, " " but our water doesn't have any inference. " " "
ok. it's a kwekerij that his fish don't feel.
a kwekerij that measures its success to the success of his predators.
and then i realized that when he said, a kwekeric that doesn't have an unsustainable, he made a big understatement, because the water that flow from the guadalquiver river.
that's a river that take away from everything that rivers present to everyday, chemical pollutants, pesticide restantes.
and while it's gone through the system, the water is cleaner than it came in.
the system is so healthy that it cleans the water.
so not just a kwekerij that doesn't feel his animals, not just a kwekerij that measures its success to the health of his predators, but a kwekerij literally is a water-cleaner.
and not just for those fish, but you and me.
because when it's thrown away the water, it's in the atlantic.
a drop in the ocean, i know, but i'll take it, and you should do that, because this love story, although romantic, is also learning.
you can say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about baars or cattle.
what we need now is a radical new agricultural skepticism, one in which the food actually tastes well.
but for many people, it's a little bit too radical.
we're not realists, we're fine.
we're loving.
we love farmers markets.
we love small family companies.
we talk about local food.
we eat organic.
" and if you suggest that these are the things that send the future of good food, then somebody says, " " hey guy, i love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world? "
" how are you going to feed the world? " " "
can i be honest?
i don't like that question.
no, not because we already produce more than enough chelories to feed the world.
a billion people today leads hunger.
one billion--that's more than ever before--because of the big inequality in distribution, not the amount.
i don't like this question because it's determined by the logic of our food system over the last 50 years.
" do grain of herbivors, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals on ground, chicken on fish, and the entire agribusiness has asked, " " if we feed more people cheaper, how bad can that be? " " "
that's been the motivation.
it has been the justice.
it has been the entrepreneur plan of the american agricultuur.
we should call it what it is, a enterprise in liquidation, a enterprise that undermines ecological capital, which makes that production right.
that's not a negotiation, and it's not agricultuur.
our everyday bread is now endangered, not by discarded transportation, not by the last combine and tractors invention, but by fertility land, not by pumps, but by clean water, not by chains, but by forests, not by fishing robots and nets, but fish in the sea
do you want to feed the world?
let's start with the question: how are we going to feed ourselves?
or better, how can we create conditions where any community can feed themselves?
to do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.
it's old, and it's accelerated.
it's strong on money, chemicals and machines, and it never has something really good to eat.
instead, let's look at the ecological model.
that's the model that trusts two billion years on-the-job experience.
look at miguel, kwekerijen like miguel, kwekerijen who are not a little bit of a world, kwekerijen that recognizes instead of extensive, rather than just intensive, kwekerers that are not just producers, experts in relationships, because they are the ones
and if i'm very honest, they're a better cook than i'll ever be.
you know, i love it, because if that's the future of good food, it's wonderful.
thank you.
i grew up, on a constant diet of science fiction.
during education, i went to school, and i went back and back, every day.
and i was always absorbed by a book, a science fiction book, which took me in mind to other worlds, and that, in stories--my unreasonable curiosity satisfaction.
and, you know, that curiosity was also manifest in the fact that when i was not in school, i was in the forest, walked down and collects samples, frogs, snakes and ponds and ponds, and she took them back, she looked under the microscope.
you know, i was a real science.
but it was all about understanding the world, understanding the boundaries of possible.
and my love for science fiction, also looked at me in the world, because what happened, this was the end of the' 60s, we went to the moon, we went to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans, jacques cousteau came in with his wonderful special
this seemed to resonate with the entire science fiction element of it.
and i was an artist.
i could draw. i could paint.
and because there were no video games and this saturated of cg films and all of these images in the media landscape, i had to create these images in my head.
you know, that all of us, if kids read a book and based on the description of the author, put something on the movie screen.
and my response was painting, signs, alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaces, all these kinds of things.
i was constantly relaxed during math bottles behind my lesbook.
that was the creativity that had to find a way out.
and something interesting happened, the jacques cousteau programs, made me excited about the fact that there was a alien world, just here on earth.
i probably wouldn't really go to a alien world one day in a spacehip.
it seemed pretty unlikely.
but that was a world that i could actually go to here on earth, which was so rich and exotic, when everything i had imagined, by reading those books.
so i decided to be diver at 15 years old.
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
but that's not what i did.
i took them to my father until he finally found a thumb school in buffalo, new york, just about the border of where we lived.
and i got my certificate, in a swim of a ymca, in the middle of the winter, in buffalo, new york.
and i saw the ocean, a real ocean, not just two years later, when we moved to california.
since then, in the age 40 years, i spent about 3, 000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of it was in submersible.
and i learned that those deep sea environment, and even the shallow oceans, are so rich with wonderful life that actually transcends our imagination.
the imagination of nature is so grateful, compared to our limited, human imagination.
until this day, i've got great awe for what i see during these diving.
and m's running love for the ocean is as strong as she had ever been.
but when i picked a career as an adult, this filmmaker was.
and that seemed the best way, to have the urge that i had to tell stories with my urge to create images.
and as a kid, i was always working on drawing comic books, etc. . .
films was the way to bring images and stories together. and that seemed meaningful.
" and of course, the stories, which i chose to tell, science fiction stories: " " terminator, " " " " aliens, " " and" " the abyss. " " "
" and with" " the abyss, " " i brought my love for underwater and thumbs together with films. "
say, the two passions combine.
" something interesting came from" " the abyss, " " that to solve a specific story-technical problem in that film, creating some sort of liquid water creature, which we're computer-generated animation, cg, around. "
and this was in the first soft surface character, cg animation, which had ever been in a movie.
and even though the film never spent money, it was barely break--i actually have to say, i witnessed something special, that was that the audience, the global public, was reliable by this beautiful magic.
you know, it's arthur clarke's law, that any enough advanced technology is not to distinguish magic.
they saw something magical.
and i was very excited about that.
" and i thought, " " wow, this is something that needs to be embraced in the movie art. " " "
" so, with" " terminator 2, " " which was my second movie, we went far beyond this. "
working with ilm, we created the curved metal guest in that film. the success hing of it would work if that effect would work.
and it did. and we created magic.
and we had the same result with the audience.
even though we made a little bit more money on that film.
so, to pull a line between those two points of experience led to, this is a whole new world, a whole new world of creativity for filmartirs.
so i started a company with stan winston, my good friend stan winston, who was the primary makeup of make-up and creature, and it was called digital domain.
and the concept of the company was that we would make a jump, along the analog processes of optical printers and all of that, and we would move directly into digital production.
and we actually did that, and it gave us an competition advantage.
but we found ourselves behind, in the mid-' 90s, in the creature and character object, which we had originally founded the company.
" so i wrote this piece called" " avatar, " " which was mean to explain absolutely the borders of visual effects, of cg effects, by the way, with realistic human emotional characters in cg and the mainkarakters would all be in cg and the world would be in c
and i was told by the people in my company, that we wouldn't be able to do this.
so i put it in the refrigerator, and i made that other film about a big ship that makes sense.
" i sold it to the studio as" " romeo and juliet on a ship. " " "
it becomes a epic romantic, passionate movie.
" what i wanted to do was, i wanted to go to the real wreck of the" " titanic. " " "
and that's why i made the film.
and that's the truth. however, the studio didn't know that.
" but i convinced them. i said, " " we go to the wrecks. we're going to film it. "
we'll use it in the opening of the movie.
it's going to be very important. it's going to be a great marketing hook.
one i convinced them to finance an expedition.
sounds crazy. but this is coming back to the theme of your imagination that creates reality.
because we actually created a reality where i found six months later in a russian submersible, two and a half miles deep, in the northern atlantic ocean, looking at the real titanic by a pattern, not a movie, not hd, but really.
and i was absolutely amazing about that.
and it requires a lot of preparation, we had to develop cameras and light and all kinds of things.
but it struck me how many of these dive, these deep diving seemed to look at spaces.
you know, it was very technical, and it requires huge planning.
you're in one of these capsule, you're going down in this dark enemy environment where there's no hope for rescue when you can't come back.
" and i thought, " " wow, it looks like i'm living in a science fiction. "
" this is very cool. " " "
and so, i had the taste of exploring the deep ocean.
of course, the curiosity, the science education of it.
it was all. it was adventure, it was curiosity. it was imagination, and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me.
because, you know, i could imagine a creature, and we could create a visual effect for that. but i couldn't imagine what i saw from that window.
and as we did some of our next expeditions, i saw creatures at hydrothermal sources, and sometimes things that i'd never seen before, sometimes things that no one had ever seen before, that actually didn't have been described by science at the moment that we saw them and they' ve
so i was completely overwhelmed and had to do more.
and so i made a very strange decision.
" after the success of" " titanic, " " i said, " " ok, i park my job as hollywood filmmaker, and i'm going to be a while full-time discoverer. " " "
and so we started plans these expeditions.
and finally, we went to the bismark, and we got it with robotic vehicles.
we went back to the wreck of the titanic.
" we took little" " bone" " that we had created that fiber fiber out. "
and the idea was to go in and do a interior study of that ship, which was never done before.
no one had ever looked at the wreck. they didn't have the tools to do it, so we developed technology to do it.
so, here i am now, on the deck of the titanic, sitting in a submersible, and look at out there that look a lot like this, where i knew that the band had played.
and i'm going to cover a little robotic gap through the gang of the ship.
when i say that i'm sitting there, i'm sitting my consciousness in the vehicle, i felt like i was physically present in the shipyard of the titanic.
and it was the most surprising kind of deja vu-experience that i once had, because i had a corner to know what would be like, for the lights of the vehicle, it actually showed up, because i had spent months on the set when we were making the film.
and the set was like a exact replica on the blueprints of the ship.
so it was an absolutely remarkable experience.
and it made me realize that the telepresence experience, that you can actually have this kind of robotic avatars, where you're aware of consciousness in the vehicle, in this other form of existence.
it was quite profound.
and maybe a little bit of a look at what might happen, which is decades beyond, as cyborg' bodies come available for exploited or other goals, in many types of post-human outcomes, which i can imagine as a science fiction.
so, these expeditions have done and really appreciate what was down there, like the deep ocean sources, where we had these amazing wonderful animals.
they are practical alien creatures just here on earth.
they live in a environmental of chemosynthesis.
they don't live in a sunlight based system like we do it.
and so you can see animals that live next to 500 degrees celcius hot water recorders.
you might think they can exist impossible.
at the same time, i was also very interested in touch in space science fiction, again the science fiction impact as a child.
and i got involved in the space community, very involved in nasa, shared on nasa advice, plans--i went to russia--i went to the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all those kinds of things, to actually go to the international space station with our 3d camera systems
and this was fascinating.
but what the final result was that i took space scientists with us to the depth.
and they take them so that they had access to astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in those extreme environmentals, taking them down to the sources and let them look and take samples and test instruments, and so on.
so, here we were, making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science.
i had made the circle around from the science fiction, you know, as a child and all doing this.
and you know, during this journey of discovery, i learned a lot.
i learned a lot about science. but i also learned a lot about leadership.
now, you would think that a director should be a leader, the leader of the ship, captain of business.
i didn't really learn about leadership until i did that expedition.
" because i had to say at some point, " " what am i doing here? "
" why am i doing this? what do i win with it? " " "
we don't make any money with these damn programs.
they're barely break--even. there's no faam involved with it.
" people think more or less that i've gone away between" " titanic" " and" " avatar" " and that i was rotating thumbs somewhere. "
i made all of these films, all these documentarys for a very limited audience.
no faam, no glory, no money. where are you doing?
you do it for the work itself, for the challenge, and the ocean is the most challenging environment that's there, for the excitement of discovery, and for that strange band that's constructed as a small group of people form a team.
because we did all these things with 10-12 people working for years at a piece.
sometimes at sea for two-three months at a piece.
and through that band, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them, and that said for you, that you have a job full of, you can't explain to somebody else.
" when you come back to wal and you say, " " we had to do this, and the fiber ontic and the demping, and the this, all of the technology and the difficultness, the human performance aspects of working on the sea, you can't explain to people. it' s
that creates a connection, creating a connection of respect.
" so when i came back to make my next film, which was the" " avatar, " " i tried that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and that in exchange, their respect. "
and that really changed the dynamics.
" so, i was again with a small team, in yet not mapped terrain, " " avatar make, " " developing new technology that didn't exist before. "
very exciting.
huge challenging.
and we became a family, over a four period of four and a half years.
and it completely changed how i make films.
so, people gave comments on how to do, say, the ocean organisms brought back and put them on the planet pandora.
to me, it was more fundamentally doing things, the process itself, which changed as a result.
so, what can we synthesize all of this?
you know, what are the learned lessons?
well, i think number one is curiosity.
it's the most powerful thing you own.
imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lof in the world.
" there are young filmmakers coming to me and say, " " give me some advice to do this. " " "
" and i say, " " don't raise yourself. "
other people will do that for you, don't touch it, don't stop yourself against yourself.
" and take risks. " " "
" nasa has this saying, " " failure is not an option. " " "
but failure has to be an option in art and discovery, because it's a leap in deep.
and no important endeavor that innovation requires no risk.
you have to be prepared to take those risks.
and that's the thought i'd like to leave you, that in whatever you do, failure is an option, not fear. thank you.
if i can give you a big idea today, it's that the whole thing we use is bigger than the sum of the parts.
instead of thinking about overwhelmed information, i want to think about how we can use information to bring patterns and trends that otherwise stay invisible.
this is a typical mortality rock to age.
the tool i use here is a little experiment.
it's called pivot. with pivot, i can filter on a particular cause, for example.
i immediately see another pattern coming out.
that's because in the middle, people are most active, and it's vulnerable.
we can reorganize the data according to death.
we see that heart disease and cancers and cancer are the usual suspects, but not everyone.
if we go beyond age and filter, for example, 40 years or younger, we see that accidents are the greatest cause of worry.
if you go deeper into that, especially for men.
and you can see what i mean: in this way, look at information in a living infographic.
if we can do this with raw data, why not content?
what we have here is the front page of every number of sports illustrated that's ever made.
everything is here. it's all on the net.
you can go to your room and try this after my talk.
with pivot, you can zoom in on a decade.
you can zoom in at some year.
you can jump to some particular number.
so i look at this. i see the athletes that came in this number, the sports.
i'm a fan of lance armstrong, so forward, i'm clicking up, and that gives me all the numbers where lance armstrong comes in.
" if i just want to look at this quick, i think, " " why don't we look at all the wheel? " " "
i'm going to step back and go into that.
now i see greg lemond.
and you can see that in this way, if you move through information, smaller and broader, in and out, you don't look, you don't get it.
you do something that's slightly different.
it's between, and we think it's changing how you can use information.
so i want to pull it down a little bit, a little bit frog.
here we've taken every page of wikipedia, and it's limited to a small summary.
the summary is made up of a little synopsis and a icon to give the bee subject.
i'll show you just the top 500-popular wikipedia pages.
but even in this limited view, we can do a lot.
we immediately get an idea of the subjects that are most popular on wikipedia.
i'm going to move on and choose government.
now i've chosen government, i'll see that the wikipedia categories that often matched there are time magazine people from the year.
this is very important because this insight was in none of the separate wikipedia pages.
you can only get it by doing a step back and look at them all.
if i look at one of these summaries, i can go deeper into the understanding time magazine person of the year by showing them all.
a look at all of these people teach me that the majority comes from politics.
some come from the natural sciences.
another smaller number is from business.
that's my boss.
one is from the music world.
what's interesting is bono is also a ted prize winner.
so we can jump to all the ted prize winners.
so we navigate through the web as if it's really a web, not page to page, but on a higher abstract transfer.
i want to show you another thing that maybe you'll be surprised.
i'm showing you the new york times website.
pivot, this application--i don't want to call it a browser, it's actually not a browser, but you can look at web pages--we bring this zoombare technology to every web page.
i'm going to step back and jump back, straight into a specific section.
the reason this matters is that i just go to web pages and look at my entire browse history in the same way.
i can go deeper into what i've done in certain times.
here's the status of the demo that i've just given.
i can play some things that i looked at earlier today.
and if i go back and look at it and look at everything, i may be able to explore my historiek from my search for searching.
here i did some nepotistic research, i was looking for binary, and live labs pivot here.
from there, i can go deeper into the page and launch them.
it's a metaphor that gets all over again, and every time it makes it much larger than the sum of the parts of the data.
today, in our world, we see data as a curse.
we're talking about the floor of flood to information.
we're talking about drowning in data.
now, if we could put that on its head, and put the web on its head so that instead of going from one thing to the next place, we get used to accomplish that we can go from many things to many things, and see the patterns that would be different.
if we can, we're not stuck in data, maybe we can actually take information out.
instead of working with information, maybe we can get knowledge out of it.
if we have knowledge, maybe there's even wisdom to find.
thank you very much.
everybody talks about happiness today.
" i've made somebody count the number of books that was the youngest five years old with" " happiness" " in the title, and he's given it up after about 40, and there were many more. "
there's a lot of interest for happiness, in researchers.
there's a lot of fortune of fortune.
everyone wants to make people happier.
but despite that mass's work, there are several cognitive traps that make it impossible to think of happiness about happiness.
and i'm going to talk about today about those cognitive traps.
this is true for ordinary people who think about their own happiness, and it's true for researchers thinking about happiness, because it turns out that we're as confused as all others.
the first fall is the nature of giving complexity.
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word because we apply it to too many things.
and i think there's a particular meaning that we might limited, but everything is considered this thing that we're going to have to give up, and we're going to have to accept the more complicated vision of what well-being is.
the second trap is the confusion between experience and memory: that's the difference between happy in your life and are happy about your life or happy with your life.
" and those are two totally different things that are thrown on a lot in the concept" " happiness. " " "
and the third fall is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can't think of a condition that impacts us without influence the importance of it.
i mean, this is really a cognitive trap.
there is no way to get this right.
now, i'd like to start with an example of somebody who was in a question and answered after one of my talk, a story.
and this was the story.
he said that he had listened to a symphony, and that it was absolutely fantastic music, and at the end of the recording, there was a horrible sound.
and then he said, really complied, that this was the whole experience.
but that didn' t.
it was the memories of the experience.
he had had the experience.
he had had a great music 20 minutes.
they weren't worthy because he stayed with a reminder; the memory was misunderstood, and the reminder was all he had to love.
what this leads to us is that we could see ourselves and others as two individuals.
there's a experienced i, who lives in the present and know the present, which is able to rebuild the past, but it only has the present.
" and the doctor takes place to our experienced--you know, if the doctor asks, " " does it hurt when i touch you here? " " "
" and then it reminds me, and it reminds me is the person who's contenting the stand and the story of our lives, and that's the person to whom the doctor is supposed to be when it asks, " " how did you feel the last time? " " "
" or" " how was your journey to albania" " or something like that. "
those are two very different things, and i experienced it, and it reminds me and the confusion between both is part of the zoo that's made of understanding happiness.
it reminds me of a storyteller.
and that really starts with a fundamental response of our memories--it starts immediately.
we're not just telling stories when we're making us to tell stories.
our memory tells us stories, which is to say, what we can preserve from our experiences is a story.
and let me begin with an example.
this is an old study.
these are real patients that have a painful intervention.
i save you the details. this is not painful today, but it was painful when this research walked in the 1990s.
they had to report every 60 seconds about their pain.
and these are two patients.
these are their defeated.
" and we asked them, " " who of them had the most pain? " " "
and that's a very easy question.
it's clear that patient b had more pain.
his colonoscopy has taken longer, and for every minute that patient a has had had had patient b had one, and more.
but here's another question: how much pain do you think they've had?
and what a surprise: the surprise is that patient has a much worse reminder of the colonoscopy than patient b.
the stories of colonoscopics differ because a very important part of the story is the disposal--and none of these stories is very inspiring or slap--but one of them is certain. . . but one of them is particularly worse than the other one.
and the worse story is the story in which the pain was in the end.
that's a quarter story.
" how do we know? because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and we asked them a lot later, " " how bad was the entire state, all the time? " " "
and it was much worse for a than b, in their memory.
well, this is a direct conflict between the experienced and it reminds me.
from the standpoint of the experienced, i've had b who's clearly heavy.
well, what you might do with patient a, and we've actually done clinical trials, and that's happened, and it's working, you could give the colonoscopy of patient a wat by just leaving the tube, without moving too much.
that causes the patient suffers, but not much, and much less than before.
and if you follow that a few minutes, you've made it worse for the experience of patient a worse, and you've done it for remembering the patient a much better because your patient a now given a better story about his experience.
what determines a story?
and that's true for the stories that we make, and it's true for the stories we're making.
what a story determines is changes, important moments and end.
finally, it's very, very important, and in this case, the end was the most important thing.
well, i'm experiencing his life.
it has moments of experience, one after another.
and you ask, what happens to these moments?
and the answer is really simple.
they're lost forever.
i mean, most moments of our lives--i've been doing it--you know, the psychological present takes about three minutes, it says.
that means, you know, in a lifetime, you have about 600 million.
in one month, there are about 600, 000.
most of them don't leave any track.
most of them don't pay attention by reminding it.
and yet, somehow you get the impression that they should be tel, that what's happening over this experience of life is our lives.
it's the finite resource we're working on while we're on earth.
and how you seem to be relevant to it, but this is not the story that it doesn't remember for us.
so we remind it, and i'm experiencing it, and i'm experiencing it, and they're really different.
the biggest difference between both is in the transition with time.
from the point of view, i've experienced you a vacation, and the second week is as good as the first week the vacation of two weeks is twice as good as the vacation of a week.
that's not how it works for me to remember.
before i remember, a vacation of two weeks is hardly better than the holiday of a week because there's no new memories added.
you didn't change the story.
and in that way, it's actually the critical variable that distinguishs a reminder of me of a experienced.
time has very little impact on this story.
it reminds me more than remembering and telling stories.
it's the person who's making decisions because, if you have a patient who, say, two colonoscopics had in two different surgeons, and has to decide which he's wrong, then he choose to choose the one with the least bad memory, and that's the surgeon he'
it's got no voice in this choice.
we don't choose between experiences.
we choose between memories of experiences. ¾ and even if we think about the future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
we think of our future as a unified memories.
and you can actually look at this, as a dictators of reminds me, and you can remind it as a person that i'm experiencing the experience that i don't need to get through the experience that i don't need to feel that if we're going
and that's quite hard to change.
i mean, how often do we use our memories?
that's one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of reminder.
and if i think about that, i think about a holiday that we had a few years ago in antarctica a few years ago, clearly our best holiday was ever, and i think quite often compared to other skills.
and i probably have my memories of that vacation of three weeks for about 25 minutes using the last four years.
now, if i had opened the map with the 600 pictures in it, i would have spent another hour.
so those are three weeks, and that's almost a year and a half hour.
there seems to be a discrepancy.
now, maybe i'm a little extreme, you know, in the limited hunger i have to use memories, but even if you do that more often, the question is, why do we get so much interest to memories compared to the importance that we're thinking about experience?
so i want you to think about a thought puzzle.
suppose you know at your next vacation that on the end of the holiday, all of your pictures will be destroyed, and you get a pill that knew you're going to remember nothing more.
would you choose the same vacation? and if you choose another holiday, there's a conflict between you.
and you have to think about how to solve that conflict.
it's not that obvious because if you think about time in terms of time, you get a particular answer.
and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer.
why we choose the vacations that we choose is a question that confronts us with a choice between the two.
now, the two legs lead to two notes of happiness.
there are really two forms of happiness that we can apply, one by me.
so you can ask, how happy is i experienced?
and then you would ask, how happy are the moments in the life of experiencing me?
and they're all--the happiness of moments is a rather complicated process.
what are the emotions that can be measured?
by the way, today we're able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experienced i've gone through time.
if you ask the happiness of reminder, i'm a completely different thing.
this is not about how happy somebody lives.
it's about how satisfaction or fulfill the person is like thinking about her life.
totally different concept.
everybody who toss these concepts on a lot of gooit will make a little bit of the study of happiness, and i'm going to have a group of students of the well-being that have made a zoom of the study of happiness in this way.
the distinction between the happiness of the experience and the persuasion of the reminds, and there are now attempts to measure the two separate, the gallup organization is doing a global pollutants in which more than half a million people are asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences
and there are more efforts done in that sense.
so over the last few years, we're starting to get insight into the happiness of the two.
and the most important lesson we've learned, i think, is that they really differ from each other.
you can know how happy someone with his life is, and you can really learn very little about how happy he leads his life, and reverse.
just to give you an idea of the correlation, the correlation is about 0.5.
that means that if you meet somebody and you would say his father is a meter of 80, how much would you know about his height?
you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty.
so many uncertainty you would have if i tell you that somebody's life gives a eight at a scale of 10, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their experienced.
so the correlation is weak.
we know something about what the satisfyingness of the experiencing i determine.
we know money is very important, goals are very important.
and we know that happiness means that we are satisfied with people we can, by bringing time with people we're allowed to do.
there are other pleasure, but this weighs.
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two legs, it will turn it out that you do very different things.
the conclusion of what i've said here is that we really wouldn't be able to think happiness as a subtle for well-being.
it's a completely different concept.
and then very quickly--another reason why we can't think of happiness is that we don't look at the same things as we think about life, and if we live effective.
so if you ask the simple question, how happy people are in california are you won't get the right answer.
if you ask that question, you think people should be happier in california if you live in ohio pakway.
and what happens if you think about life in california, you think about contrast between california and other places and that contrast is, for example, in climate.
it turns out that the climate is not so important to the experienced, and even not even thinking that it decides how happy people are.
but because i think it's the boss, it can turn out that you--that some people move to california.
and it's interesting to think about what's going to happen with people who move to california into hope happier.
well, their experienced self will not be happier.
we know that.
but one thing happens. they think they're happier, because if they think about it, they will remind about how terrible the weather was in ohio.
and they'll think they've made the right decision.
it's very difficult to think right-linely about well-being, and i hope i've given you an idea of how nice it is.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. i have a question for you.
thank you very much.
when we left the line a few weeks ago, you told me that there was a very interesting invention from that gallup pollutants.
can you share this with us you've got a few minutes over?
daniel kahneman: especially i think the most interesting result of the gallup pollutants is a number that we absolutely didn't expect.
it has to do with the happiness of the experienced.
if we look at how feelings are different to the income.
it turns out that under the income line of 60, 000 dollars a year, for americans, and then it's about a whole big group of americans, about 600, 000, a big representative steel, with a income under the 600, 000 dollars a year.
ca: 60, 000 dk: 60, 000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become unhappy as they become poorer.
up there, we see a completely flat line.
i mean, i rarely saw such a flat lines.
it's obvious, what's happening is that money doesn't bring you experience, but that a lack of money you worried about, and we can measure that miserable with big, very big precision.
for the other i, it reminds me, you get a very different story.
the more money you earn, the more satisfaction you know.
it's not true of emotions.
ca: but danny, the entire american pursuit is focused on life, freedom and pursuit of happiness.
if people who are serious about it, it seems to be able to put everything on its head that we believe about, say, fiscaal policy and so on.
is there a chance that politicians, that the country in general would take a very severe result and base public policy on it?
dk: you know, i think there's recognition of the role of fortune research in public policy.
that recognition will come slowly in the united states, which is not doubt, but in the u. k. , this is happening, and in other countries.
people recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policies.
it will take a time and people will debate about whether they want to study experience, or they want to study the evaluation of life, so we're going to have to have that debate quickly.
how we increase happiness is completely different depending on how you think, and whether you think about reminder, i or it experienced.
this will affect policy over the years, i think.
in the united states, efforts are done to measure the experience of the population.
i think that will be about a year or 20 of the national statistics.
ca: well, it seems to me that this topic is the most interesting policy problem to follow or should be for the next few years.
thank you very much for your invention of behavioral economics.
thank you danny kahneman.
i'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
and that may seem a little bit surprising, because my full-time work at the foundation, especially about vaccines and seeds, about the things we need to invent and deliver the poorest two billion people.
but energy and climate are important for these people, in fact, more important than anybody on the planet.
the climate goes worse so that their crops will not grow.
it will fall too much rain, too little.
things will change so that their vulnerable environment just doesn't exist.
and that leads to hunger. it leads to uncertainty. it leads to unstable.
so climate change will mean a disaster for them.
the price of energy is extremely important for them.
in fact, if you could choose one thing to make cheaper, to reduce poverty.
the energy peace is down.
really, so advanced civilization is based on the progress in energy.
the coal revolution led to the industrial revolution, and even in the 20th century, there was a very fast price for electricity, and therefore we have refrigerators, air conditioning, we can make modern materials and do so many things.
and so we have a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
but, now we make it cheaper--and let's make it twice as cheap--there's a new limitation, and it has to do with co2.
co2 leads to warming up the planet, and the comparison of co2 is actually a very simple thing.
if you're doing this, the co2 that's gone extinct, which leads to a temperature, and that temperature is leading to some very negative effects.
the effects of weather and maybe even worse, the indirect effects, that the natural ecosystems can't adapt to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystems that collapse.
now, the exact amount of how you go from a particular increase from co2 to which temperature size will go and where the positive return are, that's only uncertainty, but not very much.
and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad consequences will be, but they're going to be very serious.
i often asked this to top scientists.
should we really come out near zero?
can't we take half or a quarter?
and the answer is that, until we get near zero, temperature will continue to rise.
so that's a big challenge.
it's very different than a four-foot truck, for example, under a bridge of three-foot-foot bridge trying to get them underneath it.
this is something that needs to zero.
now, we spend a lot of co2 a lot more than 26 billion tons.
for every single american, this is about 20 tons.
for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
it's an average of about five tons before everyone on the planet.
and we need to, anyway, change things to get that to zero.
it's constantly going up.
just what economic changes have a little bit off, so we need to move from a quick increase to a decrease, and from a diary to zero.
this equation has four factors.
a little bit multiplied.
so, you've got something on the left, co2, which you want to bring to zero, and that's based on the number of people, the average use of services per person, the average of energy for every service, and the co2 per energy unit.
so, let's take a look at this once again and see how we can get this to zero.
probably one of these values has to come near zero.
that's high school mathematics, but let's take a look.
first of all, we have the population.
now, the world today has 6.8 billion people today.
that's up to about nine billion.
so, if we do it really well with new vaccines, health care, reproductive health care, maybe, 10 or 15 percent, but we see a rise of about 1.3.
the second factor is the services we use.
this includes all, the food we eat, clothing, tv, heating.
these are very good things, and the road of poverty means delivering these services to almost everybody on the planet.
so it's great when this number goes up.
in the rich world, maybe the top one billion, maybe we may be able to rebuild and use the consumption, but annually goes this number, on average, up, and so, in total, the service per person will double more than double.
here we have a very simple service.
you have enlightenment in your house to read your homework, fact is, these kids don' t, so they go out and read their homework beneath the lantern.
so, efficiency, e, the energy for any service.
finally, we have good news.
we have something that doesn't rise.
through various inventions and new ways of enlightenment, through other kinds of cars, other ways of building.
there's a lot of services where you need the energy that is quite far.
some individual services, even with 90 percent.
there are other services, like how we produce dung or how we deal with air trafficking, where the space for improvement is much smaller.
and so, if we're optimistic, we can tell you a factor three to even, maybe, a factor of six reports.
but for these first three factors, we've gone from 26 billion, on his best, we've gone 13 billion, and that's just not enough.
so let's look at this fourth factor--this is going to be a pinnacle--and that's the co2 emissions per energy unit.
so the question is, can you get it to zero?
if you boil coal, no.
if you cook natural gas, no.
virtually every way that we produce electricity today except the emerging renewable energy and nuclear produces co2.
and so what we need to do on global scale is create a new system.
so we need energyized.
so, if i use the term miracle, i don't want something impossible.
the microprocessor is a miracle. the pc is a miracle.
the internet and his services are a miracle.
so, people here have contributed to create many wonders.
we don't have deadline, when you have to have the wonder on a particular date.
usually you just waited, and sometimes it happens, sometimes not.
this is a matter where we actually need to move at full speed and get a miracle within a tight agenda.
now i thought, how can i really stop this?
is there some sort of natural illustrations, a demonstration that speaks to people to imagination?
i thought back to a year ago when i was a mosquito, and somehow, they liked that.
it really made them involved in the idea that there are people living with mosquitos.
so, with energy, this was the only thing i could think of.
i decided to release fireflies as my contribution to the environment here this year.
so here we have some natural fireflies.
and i told you that they don't know, even stronger, maybe they don't even leave this pot.
so, there are all kinds of gimmickachtige solutions like that, but they don't really deliver something.
we need solutions, one or several, on an incredible scale, and of an incredible reliableness, and although people are looking for many directions, i actually see only five that can deliver a significant contribution.
in addition to that, geothermal energy, nuclearfusion, biofuels.
they may be able to wear something with it, and if they do better than i expect, but my main point here is that we're going to work on each one of these five, and we can't leave any one because it looks so irrelevant, because they all have their own important
let's first look at fossil fuels, or the burning of coal, or the burning of natural gas.
what you have to do there may seem simple, but it's not.
you've got to put all the co2 up after the burning, put them under pressure, make liquid and hope that it stays there.
now, there are some of the subjects that are doing this at 60 to 80 percent level, but it's going to get it to 100 percent, and it's going to be very difficult, and determine where we have to store all that co2 is very difficult, but the hardest part of this is
who will certainly know this?
who will be guarantees for something that literally is billions of times larger than any kind of waste you can think of in terms of nuclear or other things?
this is a huge volume.
so that's hard.
the next one is nuclear energy.
there's three big problems here.
the cost, particularly in strong regulated countries, are high.
the question of security, really surely, that nothing can go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, that the spyl drive cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
and what do you do with the waste?
and, although it's not so much, there's a lot of concerns about it.
people have to feel good about it.
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable, and where should be worked.
the last three of the five, i've grouped.
these are what people often call renewables.
and that--although it's great, they don't require any fuel--they have some emphasis.
one of them is that the density of energy won by these technologies is a lot more lower than the electricity of electricity.
this is energy agriculture, then you're talking about many square kilometers, thousands of times more space than you need for a normal power station.
and they're also intermittered sources.
the sun doesn't shine all day, and not every day, and, it doesn't always be always.
and so, if you're dependent on these sources, you also have to find a way to have energy during that record that they're not available.
so, we have big cost challenges here.
we have transportation challenges.
imagine, for example, this source of energy is outside your country, not only need the technology, but you have to do with the risk of energy coming from elsewhere.
and, finally, the storage problem.
and to make that visible, i looked at all the types of batteries that are made; for cars, for computers, for telephones, for things, and compared to the amount of electric energy that uses the world, and what i found is that all batteries that we make less than 10 minutes of all energy.
so we need a big breakthrough here, something that becomes a hundred better factor than the approach we have today.
it's not impossible, but it's not easy.
this is important when you try to get those unreliable source higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you use.
if you take 100 percent, you need a miracle.
now, how are we going to find progress: what's the right approach?
is it a manhattan project? how can we achieve this?
well, we need lots of companies that work on it, hundreds of them.
each of these five paths, at least hundreds of people.
and many of them, you'll find crazy. that's good.
and, i think here in the ted group, we have a lot of people that already died this.
bill gross has different companies, including one called esolar that has huge thermal solar technologies.
marine khosla invest in tens of companies that are doing amazing things and have interesting opportunities, and i try to support that.
nathan myhrvold and i support a company that maybe surprised, nuclear power uses.
there are some innovations in nuclear, modules, liquid.
and there's no innovation in this industry for a long time, so it's not so strange that there are good new ideas.
the idea of terrapower is that instead of using just a small part of uranium; one percent, which is u-235, we decided to use the 99 percent, u-238.
a little weird idea.
people have ever thought about this, but they could never simulate whether it would work.
but by the advent of supercomputers, it can now, and yes!
with the right materials, this will probably work.
and because you use the 99 percent, it reduces cost.
you even use waste, and as a fuel, you can use all the garbage waste of current reactors.
so instead of worrying, new fuel, that's great!
it uses this uranium during the reaction. it looks like a candle.
you can see in this animation, often it's called a propulsion golf reactor.
for the fuel, this is really the solution.
i've got a picture of a place in kentucky.
this is christmas attack, the 99 percent, where the one percent is taken out.
so it's called change uranium.
that's enough for the u. s. for hundreds of years.
and by filtering seawater in a cheap way, you get enough fuel for the lifespan of the entire planet.
so, there are many challenges for the future, but it's an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go forward.
so let's think, how do we measure ourselves?
how should our report look like this?
let's first see where we need to come true, and then go to the way.
for 2050, many people speak about 80 percent reduction.
and it's really important to get that.
and that 20 percent will be used by poor countries, a part of agriculture.
hopefully we have clean forestry and cement.
so, to get that 80 percent to get the developed countries, including countries like china, have gotten their electricity.
and the other benefits: do we apply emissionsless technology in all developed countries, and are we doing that elsewhere?
that's important.
that's an important point for that report.
so, how should the report for 2020 look like?
well, it has to meet those two demands.
we need to improve efficiency to reduce emissions.
the less we expand, the lower co2 gets, and so, the lower temperature.
but in some ways, the degree we care, by doing things that don't really bring us all the way to the big destruction, just as well, or maybe even something less important than the other, that's the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.
these breakthroughs, we need to go through full speed, and we can measure those in terms of companies, subjects, rules of rules that have changed.
here's a big number of beautiful books written about.
" al gore's book called" " our choice" " and the book of david mckay book, " " sustainable energy without the hot air. " " "
they're really rewarding it really well, and they call it a framework that can be discussed in big lines, because we need to get a wide drink here.
there's a lot of them to come together.
so this is a wish.
it's a very concrete wish we find this technology.
if you gave me one wish for the next 50 years, i could choose who was president, i could choose a vaccine, something i love, or i could choose something that was invented half of the cost, without carbon emissions, this is the wish i would choose.
this is the one with the greatest impact.
if we don't get these wish, the separation between people thinking in short-term and long-term, between the united states and china, between poor and rich countries, especially the lives of those two billion will be much worse.
so, what should we do?
what do i ask you to develop?
we need to go for more funding of research.
when countries come together in places like copenhagen, they should not only talk about the co2.
they have to discuss this innovation agenda, and you're going to have to get rid of the ridiculous low spending to these innovative approaches.
we need market price, co2 tax, ceiling and trade, something that makes cost visible.
we need to be able to do the message.
this dialogue needs to be more rational and understand, including the steps that takes the government.
this is a big wish, but i think we can achieve it.
thank you.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. thank you.
thank you. now i understand more about terrapower, ok--i mean, the first place, can you give you a sense of size of investment?
bill gates: to only do the software, buy the supercomputer, all the great scientists, what we've done, that's only tens of millions, and even though we test our materials in a russian reactor to make sure our materials work well, it will be high in the hundreds of millions
the trick is building the experimental reactor, finding the few billion, finding the regulator, the location to actually build one of these first.
once you've built the first thing, if this works like conveyed, it's just obvious, because the economy, the energy density, are so different from nuclear power as we know it.
ca: and yeah, to understand it well, it's about building deep down underneath the ground almost like a kind of vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of consumer uranium, and then the process starts at the top and then works down?
bg: that's right. today, the reactor has to be filled over, so you have lots and lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong, that thing you need to open and do things in and do things.
that's not good.
so, if you have a very low-cost fuel that you can put in 60 years--think about it as a background process--put it down, and don't have any kind of complexity.
and it's just sitting there, and it's burning for 60 years, and it's done.
ca: it's a nuclear power station, which solves its own waste problem.
bg: yeah. well, what happens to the waste, you can leave it--there's a lot less waste with this approach--or you can actually take it away, and put it in another one and burn it there.
and we're beginning to make the waste that exists today, which is in the reactor or is stored in barrels.
that's our fuel to start with.
so, what a problem was from these reactors is actually a little bit in ours, and you reduce the volume of waste quite dramatically through this process.
ca: but in your global conversations about these possibilities, where is most interested in doing this really?
bg: well, we haven't seen any particular place yet, and there are interesting epidemics all over everything called nuclear, so we enjoy a lot of interest, that people from the company in russia, india, china.
i've met the state line of energy about this, to talk about how this fits in the energy agenda.
so i'm optimistic. you know the french and the japanese have done some work.
this is a variant on something that has already been done.
it's a major step forward, but it's like a rapid reactor, and many countries have built them, so everybody who has done a rapid reactor is a potential candidate to build the first.
ca: so, in your mind, time and probability of something like this?
bg: well, we need such electricity on great scale things that are very cheap, we have 20 years to think about 20 years to implement.
that's sort of a term that the environmental models have taught us what we need to do.
and, you know, terrapower, when everything goes well, what a lot of people wishes, might easily be easy.
and there are now many dozens of companies, we need hundreds of them, which, also, if their research is going well, when the funding for their trial is good, they can compete with this.
and it's the best if there's multiple, because then you can use a mix of these things.
we need at least one to succeed.
ca: in terms of possible changes on scale, is this the biggest thing you know?
bg: a energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
that would have been, even without the environmental limitation, but the environmental limitation makes it much greater.
in the nuclear sector, it's also other innovators.
you know, we don't know their work as well as these, but the modular people, that's another approach.
there's a type of liquid reactor, which seems a little bit hard, but maybe they say that about us.
so there's several, but the beauty of this is a million times as much energy as bv. a carbon molecule, and so, if you can deal with the negative effects, which are radiation, the footprint and the cost, the possibilities, in terms of effect on land and different things,
ca: if this doesn't work, what?
do we need to start with the need to make the temperature of the earth stable?
bg: if you come into that situation, it's like you have obesity, and the point is to get a heart attack.
where are you going to go? you can need a heart surgery or something like that.
there's a line of research called geo-engineering, which is different techniques that would slow down the heat that we buy 20 or 30 years to get our solution around.
that's just a kind of insurance.
you hope you don't need it.
some people say you don't even have to work on this kind of insurance because it might make you feel that you keep eating because you know there's a heart surgery to save you.
i don't know if that's mindful, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geo-engineering discussion about it, that in the back of the case, things have to happen soon, or if the innovation is going to slow a lot more slowly than we expect.
ca: climate skeptics: if you could tell one or two sentences to them, how would you convince them they're wrong?
bg: well, unfortunately, the skeptics come from different camps.
there are very few with scientific arguments.
they say there are negative feedback effects that have to do with the clouds that compensate things?
there are very, very few things that they can still claim is a chance of one million that occur.
the main problem we have here is just like aids.
you make the mistake now, and you pay a lot later.
and yes, when you have all kinds of urgent problems, the idea behind now take the pain to get the advantage later--and a bit of uncertain pain.
in fact, the ipcc report doesn't necessarily describe the worst scenario, and there's people in the rich world that go out of the ipcc and say, ok, that's all it falls.
it should be that uncertainty that let us strive us here.
but my dream is that, if you can make it economic, and you can get rid of the co2 limitations, then the skeptics say, ok, it can't care that there's no co2 coming out, i might even be wishes that there was some co2, but i
ca: and that would be your reaction to the argument of bjorn lomborg, which actually, if you spend all of these energy solving the co2 problem, it's going to be that at the end of all your other goals to try to fix the world of poverty and malaria, etc.
it's a dumb waste of resources to spend money there when there are better things we can do with it.
bg: well, the actual spending for that r& amp; d--say that the u. s. per year should spend 10 billion than now--is not so dramatic.
it doesn't have to be taken away from other things.
it's really going to be done in great beds, and it's about this reasonable people different from opinion, when you try to finance something that's incarceration.
that is, i think, usually a waste.
unless you're very close to a solution, and you only fund the learning curve, and then it becomes very cheap.
i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much less expensive.
if the idea is that you start, let's make the energy super expensive, then the rich can afford that.
i mean, all of us here would be able to pay five times so much for our energy without having to change our lifestyle.
the disaster is for those two billion.
and even lomborg has changed.
his credo is now, why don't you talk about r& amp; d talk about it.
he's still, because of his previous talk, associated with the skeptical camp, but he realized that that's a fairly lonely camp, and so he's got the r& amp; d standpoint.
and so there's a red wire that i think is important.
it's crazy how little the r& amp; d is funded.
ca: well bill, i suspect that i'm from the name of most people here when i say, that i'm really hoping that your wish is going to break down. thank you very much.
bg: thank you.
and i'd like to share with you something that i discovered a few months ago when i wrote an article for the italian wired.
" i always keep the theosaur hand when i'm writing, but i was already ready to work with the piece, and i thought i'd never seen the word" " invalide. " " "
i read you the text.
" " " embarrassing, " " confident, helpless, useless, failed, wounded, angry, mutilated, ripped, ripped, impotent, impotent, impotent, imbalance, flourish, discharged, disgusted,
" antoniemen: healthy, strong, capable. " " "
" i read this to a friend of mine, and i had to laugh at first because it was so ridiculous, but right after" " gemangeld" " began to break my voice, and i had to stop to come back to myself because of the emotional shock and the clapping
all right, this is obviously my good guy.
i remember, this is an old pressure, not right.
but it was a busy pressure from early' 80s, when i started about the lower school and a picture began to develop myself outside of my family and related to the other kids and the world around me.
i don't have to say that at the time i didn't use thesaurus at goddank.
with this description, it seems like i was born in a world where somebody like me was considered to say nothing positive about, while i'm being celebrated right now to the possibilities and adventures that i've spent in my life.
so i went right to look for the 2009 online, and i expected a big revolution.
this is the bee version of the text.
unfortunately, not much better.
" especially the last words under" " nearest antonies" " disturbing, " " complete" " and" " brilliance. " " "
it's not just about words.
it's about our opinion about people when we're training them with these words.
the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
our language affects us, and how we go to the world and how we look at other people.
a lot of old societies including the greeks and the romeins believed that the conversation of a curse was so powerful, because if you say something hard that becomes the condition.
so what kind of reality do we want to make sense, a person that's limited, or a person that's powerful?
if we do eightlessly do something simple as the jewelry of a person, a child, we constrained them, and then raise them a shadow about their strength.
don't we want to rather open doors before they open?
somebody who opened doors before me was my doctor when i was a child, at a. i. dupont institute in wil toma, delaware.
he's called dr. pizzutillo.
it italian american, whose name was apparently hard to speak, so he called dr. p.
dr. p. always wore very colorful surfaces and had exactly the good institution to work with children.
i enjoyed almost everything in the time that i was in that hospital, with exceptions of the physical therapy sessions.
i had to do a almost awful number of repeating exercises with those thick elasdles--different colors--to build my leg muscles.
i hated those elasdles more than anything.
i hated them, gave them names. i hated them.
as a five-year-old child, i've been negotiated with dr. p. to get out of those exercises without a result of course.
" one day he came in with a session--exhausted and gray and genadelless--and he said to me, " " wow. aimee, you're such a strong, powerful girl, i think you're going to leave you a little elastic. "
" if you leave you, i'll give you a hundred dollars. " " "
of course, this was a dr. p's seat of dr. p to let me do the exercises that i didn't want to do with the prospect that i would be the richest five-year-old girl of the department, but what he really did was that he was a nar,
today, i wonder how far his vision and his observation that i was a strong and powerful girl, formed my self-imaged as an inherent strong, powerful and athletic person to far in the future.
this is an example of how adults in the power population can engage the power of a child.
but in the previous situation of that the thesaurus texts, our language is to resist our evolution to reality that we all would like to say, the opportunity for the individual to see themselves as a capable.
our language doesn't follow the changes in society, and many of them have come up with technology.
especially, from medical point of view, my legs, laser treatments for bad--titanium knees and hip killings for old bodies to do more with their possibilities to go so on by the natural constraints, to be able to reject about social network platform, where people can identify themselves
so perhaps technology shows us much more clear something that has always been a truth: that everybody has something extraordinary and something powerful, and that our ability to adapt our best property is our best property.
the ability to adapt to humans is interesting, because everybody wants to talk to me all the time about overcome counterparts, and i'm going to show you something.
that sense never made me wake up, and it felt uncomfortable to answer people's questions, and i start to understand why.
" the frase" " overcome deliberate" " implies that success or happiness means that you can stand up after a challenging experience, unraveling, without having a screaming, as if my successes in life are the result of a ability to deal with the common traps of a life
but in reality, we've changed. of course, we've been drawn by a challenge, whether it's physically, emotional or both.
and my thesis is that that's a good thing.
counterintuits is not obstacle where we need to be able to live by.
it's part of our lives.
i tend to see it as my shadow.
sometimes i see a lot of them, sometimes very little, but it's always with me.
i'm not going to make sure the impact and the importance of somebody's struggle.
there's counterintuitive and challenge in life, and it's all really, and for everyone else, but the question isn't whether you're going to deal with counterparts, but how to deal with it.
so our responsibility is not simply to protect our respects for counterintuitive, but to prepare them good to go.
we don't prove our kids if we feel that they're not able to adapt.
there's a very important difference, and distinction between the objective fact that i'm a amputated and the subjective society of society about whether or not i'm beneficial.
frankly, the only real disability that i came across all the time is the world who was always opinion that you could describe me with those definitions.
in our desire to protect our side by giving them the kill facts of their medical prognose, or even a prognosis of the expectancy quality of life, we must sure that we don't explain the first thing that we really make somebody.
maybe the current way of looking at what's going on to you and how we need to fix it, somebody inflicted more than the pathology itself.
by not going from the heelness of a person, by not acknowledge their strength, we create a new disease on top of the natural struggle that they may have already.
in fact, we judge somebody's value for our society.
so we need to look through the pathology to the range of human abilities.
the most important thing is that there is a collaboration between those visible shortcomings and our best creative abilities.
it's not about to devalue those tough times or denial as something that we want to avoid or under the liquid veging, but instead of discovering those possibilities into the counterparts.
maybe the idea that i want to take you forward is that you don't have to survive, but you've got to open it open, embrace it, to understand it, to try to use a worst part, maybe even dance.
if we think of counterparts as natural, consistent and useful, we may feel less about it.
this year, we celebrate charles darwin's 200th birthday, and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago, darwin wrote a fact called the human character.
quite translated, it's not the strongest species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the kind of species adapted to change.
conflict is the genesis of creation.
in other darwin's work, we can make sure that the human ability to survive and thrive is driven by the mental struggle through conflict to transformation.
again, transformation, adaptability, that's our greatest ability.
until we get to the trial, we don't know what we can do.
maybe that's the one that gives us ourselves: self-awareness, a sense of our own power.
so we can give ourselves a gift.
we can reinvent ourselves as more than just difficult times.
maybe we can think of it as a change.
adversity is change that we haven't adapted to.
" and i think the most important block we have given is the understanding" " normality. " " "
who is normal?
there's no normal.
there's habits. there's typical. there's no normal.
and who would like to meet that poor, grauwe person as an irish?
i didn't think so.
if we can turn the paradigm of striving to normality to one of the potential, or potential, become more dangerous, then we can engage the power of many more children, and invite them to share their rare and valuable ability to share the community.
anthropologists tell us that the only thing we always need is our group group of group are useful, being able to wear.
now, there are evidence that neanderthals have seen their elderly 60, 000 years ago, their serious injuries, maybe because the life experience and survival of these people turned out to be value for the community, they didn't find these people as broken and useless; they were seen as rare and valuable
a few years ago, i was on the market in the village where i grew up in that red piece in northeast pennsylvania, and i was about a tros tomatoe.
it was summer. i had a short pants.
" i heard a man behind me saying, " " if that aimee mullins is not. " " "
i turned around, it was a older man. no idea who he was.
" i said, " " pardon, we know each other? i can't remember that. " " "
" he said, " " it's good possible that you don't know we know each other. "
" when we met, i got you from your mother's uterus. " " "
oh, that guy.
and of course, when the quarter fell.
this guy was a doctor kean, a man that i only knew through my mother's stories of that day, because of course, i came up with two weeks before my own birthday.
my mother's prenatale doctor had already gone on vacation, so the man who was losing me was a stranger for my parents.
and because i was born no divorce, and i had a very delightful feet, and a few toes on one and on the other foot, this stranger had to transmit the bad news.
" he said to me, " " i had to give your parents the prognose that you could never walk, and never have the movement-freeness that other kids have and have totally no independent life, and from that moment, you made a lie. " " "
and the special thing is that he told me that he's collected customers for my childhood, or it was that i won a spelling game in the second grade, marched with the mushroom in halloween, won my university exchanges, or one of my sports victorys, and he used it,
of course, he called this the x factor, the potential of human will.
no prognose can predict how powerful this can be as assumptions for the quality of somebody's life.
" doctor kean went on, he said, " " i feel like, if it's not constantly counterintuitive, and even with just limited support, a child will achieve something. " " "
see, doctor kean changed his thinking.
he understood that there's a difference between medical conditions and somebody could do with it.
and over time, my thinking has changed, because, if you asked me as a 15-year-old or i would dialed my art for real legs, i didn't have any time.
i used to have used to do this normality.
if you ask me now, i don't know it just like that.
that's because of the experiences that i had with it, not despite the experiences that had with it.
maybe this has changed in me because i'm exposed to people who opened doors for me than those who wanted to limit me and shaking.
look, you only need a human being that shows you the epiphany of your own power, and you go there.
if you can give somebody the key to its own force, the human mind is so shocking, if you can, and at a very essential moment, you can open a door for someone, you're feeling it in the best way.
you teach them to open doors.
" the exact meaning of the word" " educatie" " goes off" " educe. " " "
that means that what's inside of the world is bringing forward, potentially--potentially--
so again, what potential do we want to bring out?
there was a case study in the' 60s in england, where they went from gymnasia to schools communities.
" it was called" " streaming trials. " " in the united states, we call it" " follow. " " "
they divide students from 10, nine, seven, and so on.
the 10 students get a very hard thing to do, the best teachers, etc.
for a period of three months, they gave four students a 10, and they told them they were a long time, they were intelligent.
at the end of the three months, they came to 10-nivo.
" the heartbreaking side of this study is that they told the 10 students they were" " celebrate. " " "
and that also happened after three months.
those of you who were in school, next to the people who had completed.
a key part of this study was that the teachers were also kept the crazy.
the teachers didn't know there was a little bit more exchange.
and they were told, these are the students with a lot, these are the ones with celebrate.
and so they were teaching them, and so they treated them.
i think the only real disability is a crazy mind, there's no hope for me.
he doesn't see beauty.
he doesn't have our natural, child curiosity anymore, and it doesn't have our capacity to imagine our imagination.
instead, if we can reinforce the mind to stay, to see beauty in itself and others, to be curious and imagination, we actually use our power for good.
if a mind owns these qualities, then we're able to create new reality, new ways of being.
i want to close with a poem by a 40-century perzisian poet, hafiz, which my friend jacques dembois told me about.
" the poem is called" " the god who only know four words. " " "
" " " every child knows god, not the god of almostmen, not the god of do--not the god of do--but the god who knows only four words he repeat, say, " " come dance with me, " " come dance with me. "
thank you.
