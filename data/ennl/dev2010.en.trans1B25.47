last year , i showed these two slides to show that the polar ice number , which had had about the size of the size of the u. s. u. u. u. u. s . , 40 percent .
but this actually underestimate the serious problem of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
the ice sheet on the north pole , in some sense , is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it put out in the winter , and it shrink in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a accelerated version of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is shown in red .
as you can see , it puts it out to dark blue .
that &apos;s the annual ice during winter .
and it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
the permanent ice , five years of parent , is almost like blood , that &apos;s in the body .
in 25 years it has gone from this to this .
and that &apos;s a problem because the frozen soil is warming around the northern ice ocean , and there &apos;s a very large amount of frozen carbon that , when it unfolds , by microbes is converted into methane .
compared to the total amount of pollutants in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we transmit the acid point .
in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane borrelt methane from the water .
last winter , professor katey walter went from the university of alaska with another team to another shallow lake .
whoo ! she &apos;s ok. the question is whether we &apos;re going to be .
and one reason for that is that this huge heat source of greenland is heating from north .
this is a meadowwater river .
but the watervolume is bigger than ever .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in south greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up because it tastes land , this is the place where it comes in the sea .
these currents take quickly .
on the other side of the planet , on the south pole , is the largest icesmassa on earth .
in the last month , scientists have known that the entire continent now has a negative balance .
more specifically , the ice in the west of the south pole is very rapidly melting , particularly some underwater islands .
the whole continent is six meters of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the two largest icesmassa , there are now new lakes , which were still glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population gets half of his drinking water from that meadow .
in the andes , this is the source of drinking water for this city .
there are more flows now .
but when they disappear , it disappears the drinking water .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the snow suit of the sierra .
it &apos;s in the water reserve .
and as you could read , the predictions are serious .
this global drought has led to a dramatic increase of forest agencies .
and the number of natural disasters around the world has gone up with an incredible and never seen speed .
four times more in the last 30 years than in the previous 75 years .
this pattern is completely unsustainable .
if you look at it from a historical context , you can see what happened here .
over the last five years , we added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours .
25 mijoen tons every day in our oceans , look closely at the eastern area of the pacific , from america , westwaarts , and every side of the indian subcontinent , there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans .
the only big cause of global warming , alongside deforestation , which is at 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the very greatest problem .
the united states is one of the two biggest emissions , along with china .
and there was a proposal to build many more coal plants .
but we see a omrain .
these are the coal plants whose building was planted in the last few years and where green alternatives were proposed .
however , there &apos;s a political battle going on in our country .
the coal and oil industire gave 250 million dollars last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction .
and that image did me think about something .
around the christmas guy , at home in tennessee , about four billion liters of stone coal--
you &apos;ve probably seen it in news .
this is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around the christmas .
one of the advertisements of the coal industry around the christmas was this one .
&quot; video : &quot; &quot; frosty the coal is a happy , christmas guy . &quot;
he &apos;s abundant here in america , and he causes our economy to grow .
frosty the coal is cleaner .
&quot; he &apos;s affordable and cute and employees keep their job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here &apos;s a big part of the coal in west virginia .
the biggest mine of the country is the great boss of massey coal .
&quot; video : don blankenship : &quot; &quot; let me be clear. al gore , nancy pelosi , harry travel , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al gore : so the alliance for climate protection has produced two campaigns on rope .
this is a piece of one of them .
&quot; video &quot; &quot; by coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s our most important goal to express a huge amount of advertising to light for the light and translate the truth of coal .
fact is , coal is not dirty .
we find that it &apos;s clean--and it smells still .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s talk about that .
actor : clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a look at this hypermodern clean coal .
fantastic ! the machines make some noise .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
despite the fact that the burden of coal is one of the most important causes of global warming is changing the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here .
look closely around , this is the clean coal technology today .
al gore : finally , the positive alternative in our economic challenges and national security area .
video : voice : it &apos;s wrong in crisis , the economy , national security , climate crisis .
the red wire at all of these things , our dependence of fossil fuels , such as dirty coal and imported oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get out of this .
if you look at america of 100 percent clean electricity , within 10 years .
a plan to get to america again , a plan that makes us safer and fight global warming .
finally , a solution that is size enough to solve our problems .
repower america. discover how .
al gore : and the last one .
video : voice : it &apos;s about to give america again .
one of the fastest ways to end our dependence on old , dirty fuels that help our planet for soap .
man : here &apos;s the future. wind , sun , a new energy system .
man # 2 : new investments to create well paid jobs .
voice : repower america. time to become realistic .
&quot; al gore : there &apos;s an old african speakers saying , &quot; &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot;
&quot; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
last year , i gave a introduction about the lhc at ted .
and i promised to come back with a update about how that machine works .
so here i am. for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever passed away 27 kilometers in the course of the world .
it has to mimic conditions that were present less than a billionth of seconds after the universe started to be 600 million times a second .
huge ambitious , so !
this is the machine under geneva .
we took pictures of that mini @-@ big bangs inside detectors , and this is the one i work with. it &apos;s called the atlas detector--44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
spectacular photograph of atlas so that you can see the scale .
in september 10 last year , we first put the machine for the first time .
this picture was taken by atlas .
and that made a party of control room .
it &apos;s a photograph of the first particle ray that went all the way around the lhc , and it &apos;s a picture of a piece of the lhc , where particles were thrown into the detector .
in other words , when we saw that photograph on september 10 , we knew that the machine worked , which is a huge victory .
i don &apos;t know if this got the greatest accident , or this , when someone went to google and saw that the internet page looked like this .
what that means is that we &apos;ve made both a cultural impact .
a week later , we had a problem with the machine , which had to do with these golden wires .
those wires conduct 13 thousand amperes when the machine worked at full force .
&quot; the engineers under you will say , &quot; &quot; not true. it &apos;s too small wires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can do that because they &apos;re superconducted at low temperatures .
so in minus 271 degrees , then colder than the space between stars , those wires that conduct power .
in one of the connections between the nine thousand magnets in the lhc , a constructiveout .
and then the wire became something warmer , and suddenly there was electric resistance against that 13 thousand amperes .
this was the result .
this is even more impressive if you realize that those magnets were over 20 tons of roads , and they were about 30 centimeters .
we damaged about 50 magnets .
we had to get them out , what we did .
we all got them up then .
now they &apos;re back on the road .
late march , the lhc will be intact again .
we &apos;ll turn it back again , and we &apos;re expecting measurements in june or july so that we can move beyond figuring out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , those accidents have started the debate again about the value of scientific research. it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond ever , is the value of things like the lhc .
&quot; i &apos;m going to let the last words at the english scientist humphrey davy , who , i suspect , during defending the valueless experiments of his student , his student was michael faraday , this said , &quot; &quot; nothing is so dangerous to take the progress of the human mind than
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to return to your childhood when you played block .
when you found out how to grab it up , they &apos;ve been picking up and moved , you &apos;ve actually got to learn problems to solve by dealing with space relationships .
spatial insight is strong related to understanding the world around us .
as a informaticus , inspired by the use of physical interaction with objects--along with my adviser , jeevan kalanithi and my collaborator , i started to ask--what if we could use a computer , rather than a kind of a digital fingertip , which moves on a flat desktop
and can we do it like we want ?
this is a question that we decided that we decided to find an answer by building siftables .
shortly , a siftable is a interactive computer on size of a cookie .
they can be moved by hand , they can feel each other , detect their movement , and they contain a screen and wireless contact .
the core notion is the physical tradeity , just like blocks they can be moved by gratifying .
moreover , siftables are an example of a new ecosystem for manipulating digital information .
because these tools have more physical mindset , being aware of their movement and from each other , and even the way we move them , there are different new and ugly interactions .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this siftable has been set out to show a video , which is playing forward forward and plays differently , left behind .
these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
if they &apos;re placed alongside side , they &apos;re going to be interested in one another .
and when they &apos;re surrounded , they also noticed this , and they can get some nervous .
and then they feel movement and slope .
we already realized that one of the interesting consequences of this interaction , the use of everyday gesture , as the gifts of a color as it was a fluid .
in this example , three siftables paint paints paint , and i can use them to pour color in an empty empty , where they &apos;re mixed .
and if we have overstate , we pour some back .
there are some handsome possibilities for education , mainly games with language , mathematics and logic that we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and see the result immediately .
here i &apos;m showing--this is the development of a fibonacci series by a simple bill program .
here we show a game that &apos;s a cross between scrabble and boggle .
the principle is that in every round , you get a random letter on any siftable , and formed words being controlled in a dictionary .
after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s completely recruiting , and it appears a new series of letters inhore opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids on excursion to the media lab , and i &apos;ve managed to let them try and make it a video .
they were really gone .
and one of the most interesting things about this application is that people almost don &apos;t need instructions .
&quot; all you have to say is &quot; &quot; make words &quot; &quot; and they know exactly what to do . &quot;
here are some other people testing .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester , right below .
it turns out he only wanted to stack the siftables .
for him , these were just blocks .
here &apos;s a interactive painting shown here .
we wanted to develop a platform for learning language .
this is felix that &apos;s demonstration .
it can bring new characters into the scene , just by putting the siftable with that character of the table .
here he leaves up the sun .
video : the sun comes up .
david merrill : now he has brought a tractors in the scene .
video : the orange tractor .
well done ! yeah !
it &apos;s because of shuffled siftables and the side of each other , it can react the characters to each other--video : waf !
dm : and that &apos;s how they tell their own story .
video : hello !
dm : it &apos;s a story with a open end .
and he decides how it &apos;s coming .
video : the cat flies .
dm : the last example i &apos;m going to show you today is a synthesizer and live music instruments that we &apos;ve developed recently , where every siftables produces a sound like the lead , bass and drum .
one of the fields has four different variations , where you can choose which you want to use .
these sounds can be put in empty siftables so that you can determine the pattern itself .
you put a sound in the pattern through an empty siftable empty , and there are live control effects available like reverb and filter .
they &apos;re added to a sound and adapted by side .
beyond the general effects like pace and volume that are applied to the entire pattern .
let &apos;s see .
video : dm : we &apos;re starting with a lead in two siftables , to a first pattern , compared by a extra lead .
now i &apos;m going to put the basline .
video : dm : now i add a little bit of work .
dm : dm : and now i &apos;m going to buy the filter on the drums so that i can influence the effect of live .
dm : dm : i can accelerate it completely through the pace of the pace .
dm : now i &apos;m going to buy the filter on the bas for some more expression .
dm : dm : i can rearrange the pattern while it plays .
so i don &apos;t have to plan everything , but i can improvise the whole longer and make it shorter as i want .
finally , the thickness of the whole by side by the volume siftable to the left .
thank you .
as you can see , my passion is going to make new human beings--computer interfaces that are better off the way our brain and our bodies work .
and today , i had the time to show you a new element in this design region together with some possibilities we &apos;re developing in the lab .
the thought that i want to suggest about is that this is just the supply to a whole new generation of tools for the interact with digital media , bringing the information to our world as we want it .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books write my work , but also so much more than that .
for a long time , i &apos;ve been obsessed with writing , and i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to change that .
and yet , recently , something peculiar happened in my life and career , that i had to go back to my relationship with my work .
&quot; it started with a book that i &apos;ve written recently , a memoire : &quot; &quot; eat , pray , pray , love , love , &quot; &quot; which was very contradictory to my earlier work all over the world and became an international bestseller . &quot;
and the consequence is that people now rebuild me everywhere , and always , as if i &apos;m being killed .
it &apos;s true true-----------------------------------------------------------
&quot; people come to me and ask questions , &quot; &quot; are you not afraid you can never save this success ? &quot;
are you not afraid that you &apos;re going to keep writing your entire life , but never going to publish a book where people will walk for warm ?
&quot; are you not afraid ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reassured , you know .
of course , that would be very. but i remember i was about 20 years ago--i was when a teenager--when i told me i wanted to become a writer .
&quot; people said , &quot; &quot; are you not afraid you &apos;ll never get success ? &quot;
are you not afraid of rejection that you &apos;re going to get underneath ?
&quot; are you not afraid that you &apos;re going to get your life to this work without ever coming out of something , and you &apos;ll die on the rubble of your broken dreams with your mouth full of bitter axis of failure ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
something in that stream .
&quot; in short , my answer comes down to those questions , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things that are called .
always .
but i &apos;m also scared for lots of other things , you don &apos;t want to know what all of those things are .
for seaweed , for example , and other english things .
but in terms of writing , i &apos;m asking myself the last time where that fear comes from .
is it rational ?
is it logical that somebody is created to be fearful for the work that they &apos;ve put to their opinion on earth ?
what &apos;s so special about creative processes that we worry about the effects of the mentality , something that doesn &apos;t happen at different work at all .
take my father. he was a chemistry engineer , and i can &apos;t remember that in the 40 years he was ever asked anyone to him if he wasn &apos;t afraid .
&quot; like , &quot; &quot; john , how about your chemistry control ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , it didn &apos;t talk about it .
to be fair , chemistry engineers have also not to be the reputation for piece of manic @-@ depressed alcoholists .
well , writers do have such a reputation .
not just writers , other creative people have apparently to be the reputation mentally unstable .
look at the grim death table under the most magnificent creative minds of the 20th century .
many died young , often through their own .
and even those of you who don &apos;t get killed , seem to be under their gifts .
&quot; in the last interview for his death , norman email said , &quot; &quot; with each of my books , it &apos;s a piece of myself died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s kind of a thing to say about your lifework .
but of this kind of expenses , we don &apos;t look up anymore .
we &apos;ve all heard it before , and we &apos;ve accepted it with all of them .
the delightful thought is that creativity is incredibly connected to suffering , and that a artists will eventually lead to miserable .
so i want to ask anybody here today : can you live with that idea ?
do you find that okay ?
because now i &apos;m thinking about thinking about it , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a very nice thought at all .
and i think it &apos;s a reluctant .
and also dangerous .
i wouldn &apos;t like to think that this is going to be this century .
we can get creative minds much better to live .
i &apos;m sure it would be in my situation , in my situation , particularly dangerous to live to that dark thought .
especially the phase in which my career is now .
go after , i &apos;m a young , amper @-@ 14 years .
maybe i can go through four decades .
it &apos;s very likely to be very likely to do anything that i &apos;m going to see through the outside world as the work that followed on that extraordinary successnal book .
we &apos;re here with friends beneath each other , so i can get you wrong : high @-@ quality success is already behind me .
jemig , what an idea !
if you &apos;re going to think that way , you &apos;re already sitting at the morning at nine hours .
so i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d rather like to do the work that i love .
&quot; the question is , &quot; &quot; how ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that i can only get writing when i build a psychological protection in the process .
i have to show you a safe distance in writing between myself and by the way , very understand fear of the responses on my future funds .
i &apos;ve been looking for ways in the last year to do that .
i &apos;ve been in history , and i &apos;ve earned in other civilizations to see if others have found a better way to help creative people to deal with the emotional complications of the creative process .
my quest has brought me to the old greeks and romeins .
notice , because it &apos;s a long and complicated story .
in the age of ancient greeks and romeins , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity was coming from them .
people believed that creativity was a divine mind , who came from a distant , unfinished place to man , for vague and unknowable reasons .
&quot; the greeks called these helpful minds of creativity &quot; &quot; demons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and socrates also believed that he had a demoon who was injecting him wisely .
the romeins had a similar idea .
&quot; it was called a &quot; &quot; genius . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing is that the genius with a genius doesn &apos;t have a special pienter person .
in their experience , a genius was a kind of magical divine entity that was locked up in the walls of the shop studio .
a little like dobby de houseelf .
if the artist was working , the genius assistance took place .
invisible , he gave shape to work .
brilliant ! that &apos;s exactly the distance that i talked about earlier , the psychological protection against the results of your work .
everybody knew what it was like in his work .
the artist was so taken in protection for instance to be too much narcissistic .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t get all honor .
because everybody knew that a invisible genius had helped you .
your work was declining , it wasn &apos;t just you .
everybody knew you had a rather uncomfortable genius .
for a long time , it has been how in the west was considered creativity .
then the renaissance came , and everything changed .
there &apos;s a very new idea : the individual human being is the center of the universe and is above all gods and mysteries .
no space for mystical creatures , sent from the divine world .
that was the beginning of the rational humanism .
people believed that creativity came out of the individual .
and for the first time in history , artists was said that they were a genius , not that they had a genius .
i have to tell you that i find that a big mistake .
in order to make a person , a single individual believe that he or she is the cam , the essence , the source of the eternal mystery , of everything god divine , creative and known--that &apos;s something too much responsible for a fragile human psyche .
it &apos;s like you ask someone to go into the sun .
egos are blown up to giant proportions , and there are unimaginable high expectations of performance .
and i think this pressure has made a lot of artists for the last 500 years .
&quot; if that &apos;s true , and i think , the question is , &quot; &quot; what now ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
can we do this differently ?
can we understand an older understanding of the relationship between humans and the creative mystery ?
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t impress 500 years of rational humanism in a 18 minutes expensive speech .
probably , in the audience , there are people who have rid of scientific doubts about the idea that 11 @-@ year @-@ old pieces with some feeenpoeder bring the work of artists to inspiring altitude .
it doesn &apos;t seem to me that i &apos;m going to take you all of you .
and yet , i wonder .
why not ?
why shouldn &apos;t we follow that thought ?
it &apos;s just as much timber as all the other explanations of the totally deceivable unconsciousness that decided in the creative process .
everybody who &apos;s got to try to create something--so , in fact , all the attendance here--knows that the creative process doesn &apos;t always behave rational .
sometimes it feels almost paranorual .
i recently met the great american poets ruth stone .
she &apos;s thick in the ninety. her whole life already writes poems .
she told me about her youth in rural virginia .
sometimes , when she was working on the field , she felt , she heard a poem over the country .
it was , as she said , as if there was a big wave air coming on .
such a poem than about the country on her .
she felt that the ground underneath her feet began to shake and knew that she was at that time , one thing was to do : run for her life .
she ran home , chasing by the poem , and she had to see as fast as pen and paper .
when the poem came through her was that her only chance to write it .
sometimes she wasn &apos;t fast enough .
then they ran , and they ran , but don &apos;t get the house .
at such moments , the poem went through her , disappear about the fields , searching--in her words--to another poet .
and there were times--this is the most beautiful part of the story--that they almost missed the poem .
and then she was looking for pen and paper , and she kicked the poem through her .
right at that time , she had a pencil .
and with her other hand , she told me that , she plucked the poem from the air .
she grabbed the poem at his tail , and she pulled it back into her body as she described it .
in those cases , the poem came in all of a piece of paper , but it was in reverse order .
and when i heard that , i thought--what happens to happen , that &apos;s what my creative process is doing too !
that &apos;s how my creative process doesn &apos;t work ! i &apos;m not a medium .
i &apos;m a muilezel , who &apos;s on the same time at the same time every day , and it &apos;s with blood , sweat , tears , tears .
but even in that everyday swap , i &apos;ve had this kind of experience .
you &apos;re going to know it also , that feeling that there &apos;s creative ideas in your fixing from a source that you can identify impossible .
so what is that for resource ?
how can we use it without being crazy ?
in a way that &apos;s good for us ?
the best issue example i can think of is musical tom waits .
a few years ago , i interviewed him for a magazine .
we talked about this .
tom has been a big part of his life that has been the tone of the violence today that tries to get out of all the power to get grip to the unlimited creative impulses that come up with him .
with the years , tom became a little bit more quiet .
one day he drove in los angeles over the highway , and radically changed the process .
and as he drove there , he heard a little bit of a melody .
it fought him , as inspiration that does more often , unprecedented , unprecedented .
it was a beautiful melody , and he wanted to hold it .
but it didn &apos; t .
he had no paper , no pen , no tape recorders .
&quot; and the well @-@ known tension took back from him , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve lost the melody , and then it keeps me forever . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos; t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he didn &apos;t panic , but he stopped that whole mental process , and he did something new .
&quot; and he looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t see sorry , can &apos;t you see me behind the wheel ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you really think i can describe a song now ? &quot;
if you really want this song to get there , you &apos;ve got to go back to it later if i have time for you .
that &apos;s not , go ahead and drop somebody else .
&quot; go near leonard cohen . &quot; &quot; and from that point , the process is very different . &quot;
the work itself is even the same , with the known dark .
but the heavy tension that the creative process in him disappeared when he was distanting the genius .
and the genius was too close to the skin , and it just stopped miserable .
tom realized that there was no reason for going on .
it could also be a wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the peculiar aspect that was not entirely from tom itself .
that story has changed my way of working .
i &apos;ve already had a propelled thing .
i was in the middle of the writing process of food , praying , lovely .
at some point i &apos;m despaired in despair .
you know that : your work doesn &apos;t want good , and you think it becomes a horrible disaster. the worst book ever .
not just bad , really terrible bad .
i wanted to take the whole project .
and then i remembered tom that went to his genius , and i decided to make a attempt too .
i turned off from my manuscript , and i founded me to an empty angle of the room .
&quot; and i said hardly , &quot; &quot; listen , we both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that &apos;s not just me . &quot;
you can see that i put everything in it all i have .
i can &apos;t give you more .
if you think it &apos;s better , you have to get your thing to do .
you know ? don &apos;t you do that , unfortunately .
i &apos;m just writing , because that &apos;s my work .
&quot; oh , and in the notulen , i &apos;m going to be able to say that i &apos;m just being on the office today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yeah----eventually it &apos;s coming down here . . .
centuries ago , in the north african desert , people came together to dance with moonlight on sacred music .
hours and hours behind , up to the morning .
that was always great , because the dancers were full of professionals .
but sometimes , sometimes sometimes , something extraordinary happened .
one of those dancers became than transcendent .
you know what i mean by that , you &apos;ve ever seen something like this in a performer .
it was as if the time was quiet , and it was dancing by a gate .
he didn &apos;t do anything else than the thousands of nights before , but now everything fell together .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t seem to be a human longer .
in him , under him , it glows above him .
it &apos;s a divine fire .
&quot; if something happened at the time , people knew what it was like then they started clapping and grilled them , &quot; &quot; allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that was it for them .
by the way , a nice little bit of historical fact : when the moral hit south spain , they brought this habits with them .
&quot; but the talk has changed by the centuries of &quot; &quot; allah , allah , allah , &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; ole , ole , ole . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what you hear today with stewed fights and bottles .
&quot; if a artist in spain does something impossible or magic , then they call , &quot; &quot; allah , ole , ole , allah , great , bravo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlimited , see , a glimpse of god .
exactly what we need .
however , the dancer is that the dancer was discovering the next morning that on tuesday , he has no divine charge anymore .
at that time , he &apos;s a little bit of a little older man that may never be able to get more to these heights .
maybe anyone will never touch god during his dance .
now , what do he have to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
that &apos;s really hard to match for a creative mind .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be that painful .
suppose you &apos;re not going to explain that the most unusual aspects of your person from your choice .
suppose you believe that you &apos;ve got to read them a while from a non @-@ specific source .
when you &apos;re done with it , they &apos;re passed on to somebody else .
that &apos;s how you consider it , it turns out everything .
and i &apos;m going to have that thought .
for the last few months , i &apos;ve been working on a book that will soon appear soon. the book where too long had been traveling to travel .
the successor of that illustrious progress .
and when my thoughts go to me , i &apos;m going to keep the same thing , don &apos;t be frightened. don &apos;t see it against it .
just do your work .
keep doing your thing , whatever it is .
if it &apos;s your job to dance , dance .
&quot; if the divine genius that you &apos;re rejected is decision to make something of the wonderful source in your work at any time , then &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
it doesn &apos;t happen , it &apos;s not a dance than it is .
&quot; and then , &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what i believe about heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ole ! &quot; &quot; anyway , because we &apos;re from pure human love and self @-@ proof , we &apos;re going to keep going on . &quot;
thank you .
thank you .
june cohen : ole !
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects , about the human genome and what that can mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting from a new point : we were digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code to a new phase in biology with designing and synthesizing life .
so we &apos;ve always tried to ask the big questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; is something that i think a lot of biologists have tried to understand it on various levels . &quot;
we &apos;ve tried different approaches , bringing it back to minimal components .
we &apos;re now digitized it almost 20 years .
when we &apos;ve gone through the human genome , it went from the analog world of biology , to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , with the smallest genome for a species that can multiplied itself into a laboratory .
and we &apos;ve tried to see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we can throw in the order of hundreds of genes out of the 500 or something like that .
but if we look at the metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours .
believe me , this is simple .
but when we look at all the genes that we can switch out per piece , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would be a living cell .
so we decided that the only route was forward to synthesize this this chromosome so that we could reject the components to be able to ask the some of the most fundamental questions .
&quot; and so we started questions like , &quot; &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the chemistry allow us to make these very large molecules that we &apos;ve never seen before ?
&quot; and , if we do that , can we get a chromosome &quot; &quot; started ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a chromosome is just one piece of chemical inert material .
so , our pace of digitalizing life is accelerated in exponential ways .
our ability to write the genetic code loses quite slowly , but has increased .
and our last point would put it on an exponential curve right now .
we &apos;ve started over 15 years ago .
there were some stages for it , starting with a bio @-@ ethical supply for the first experiments .
but it turns out that the synthesis of dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters in length , and it &apos;s a degeneration process , so the longer you make it piece , the more mistakes there are .
so we had to create a new method for bringing together these little bits and correcting all the mistakes .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome phi x 174 genome .
that &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the bits , we did the mistakes .
and had a dna molecule from about 5 , 000 letters .
the exciting part started when we stopped a small piece of chemical dust in the bacteria , and the bacteria went to read the genetic code , and they went viral particles .
the viral particles became then left from the cells , they came back and killed the e. coli .
i was recently talking to the oil industry , and i said she &apos;s able to understand that model too well .
they laugh more than you .
that &apos;s why we think this is a situation where the software can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted something much bigger .
we wanted to build the full bacterial chromosome .
that &apos;s more than 2 , 000 letters genetic code .
that &apos;s why we decided to build them in cassettes the size of viruses , so that we could vary the cassettes . . .
to understand what the actual objective components of a living cell .
the design is crucial , and if you start with digital information in the computer , that digital information needs to be very accurate .
when we first brought together this genome in 1995 , the standard precision was a mistake per 10 , 000 base pairs .
eventually , after resequencing 30 mistakes. if we had used the original sequence , it didn &apos;t have been able to start .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long who have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build so sufficient sub @-@ units that we need to design so that they can go together .
we design unique parts here .
you may have read that we put water inside it .
think about this : we have a four @-@ critical genetic code : a , c , g and t .
now , triggers of that letters for roughly 20 amino acids--that there &apos;s a single @-@ lette pigeon for any amino acid .
so we can use the genetic code to write words , phrases , thoughts .
initially , we &apos;ve just completed it .
some people were disappointed that there were no poems .
we designed these bits that we can eat them with enzymes .
there are enzymes that they repair and put together .
and we started to make bits , starting with pieces that were five to 7 , 000 letters long , and you &apos;ve got each other , and you &apos;ve got pieces of 24 , 000 letter , take sets of that , to 72 , 000 .
in each stage , we grow a flood of these pieces so that we could sequence them because we want to create a process that is very robust--that will see you later .
we &apos;re trying to achieve automation point .
so this looks like a basketballfinale .
once we come to the really big pieces--over 100 , 000 base pairs--they don &apos;t grow so easily in e. coli .
that requires the spread of all modern tools of molecular biology .
that &apos;s why we went too guess in other mechanisms .
&quot; we knew a mechanism called &quot; &quot; homologe recombination , &quot; &quot; which is used by biology to repair dna , that can feed pieces together . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of it .
there &apos;s a organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can adapt three million rad .
that &apos;s what you see in the upper panal , scraping up the chromosome .
12 ot 24 hours later , he put it back together , exactly like the first time .
there are thousands of organisms that can do this .
and these organisms can be completely disconnected .
they can live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m sure absolutely sure that life can exist in space , that can continue to find a new aquatic environment .
nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of things out there .
here &apos;s an actual actual micro photograph of the molecule that we &apos;ve made with these processes--actually with just yeast--mechanisms with the right design of the bits we did in .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , they &apos;re automatically put together .
this is not a electron microscope. this is a regular microscope photograph .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures taken over a six @-@ second period .
this is the publication that we recently did .
this is more than 2 , 000 letters of genetic code .
it &apos;s the greatest molecule ever made by people , with a clear structure .
the moleculargewicht is over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a 10 @-@ boyfriend letter , no spanish , then there &apos;s some 142 pages just to print the genetic code .
okay , how do we start up a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
with a virus , it &apos;s obviously pretty easy .
with a bacterium , it &apos;s much more complicated .
it &apos;s also simple , if you give you eukaryotes , like we are , you &apos;re just going out the cell nuclei and you &apos;re doing another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re familiar when it &apos;s right .
in the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we can perform a full transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and activate it .
we &apos;ve painted a chromosome from a microbensoort .
these are about so far away from each other as people and mice .
we added some extra genes so that we could select this chromosome .
we &apos;ve talked to enzymes to make all the proteins .
it was quite sensational when we stopped this in the cell--and you will be able to appreciate the very sophisticated graphic images here--the new chromosome went into the cell .
we even thought he was going to come , but we tried to figure out what &apos;s going on .
this is a essential evolution mechanism .
we discover all kinds of species that have recorded a second chromosome or some third somewhere that they add thousands of properties in one time to the species .
people who imagine evolution as if there &apos;s a gene changing at the same time , they don &apos;t have a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called restriction enzymes that actually tell dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell didn &apos;t have one .
the cell--the chromosome we stopped in it--well .
it was emphasizing , and it recognized the other chromosome as odd material , ate , and therefore we had only the cell with the new chromosome .
he was blue because of the genes we had stopped in it .
and in very short time , all the characteristics of one species , and he changed completely in the new species based on the new software that we had stopped in the cell .
all proteins changed , the membranes changed--when we distract the genetic code , it was exactly what it changed .
this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we &apos;re able , by changing the software dna , to change things fundamentally .
all right , i &apos;ve learned that this is not a creation--this is ongoing in three and a half billion years of evolution , and i &apos;ve found that we &apos;re going to make almost a new version of cambrian explosion where there &apos;s a major scale of new species based on this digital design
why would you do this ?
i think it &apos;s pretty clear when you look at what it takes .
we &apos;re going soon from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
there are three people on this planet now . . .
for each of us who lived in 1946 ; within 40 years , there will be four .
we have trouble with nutrition , using clean water , medicine , fuel for six and a half @-@ half billion .
that &apos;s hard to do that for nine .
we use five billion tons of coal , over 30 billion barrels of oil .
that &apos;s 100 miloen barrels a day .
when we take biological processes in eyes , or whatever process to replace it , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all these carbon dioxide of the dust coming into the atmosphere .
all of our global discoveries , we now have a database with about 20 million genes , and i would like to think of it as the design components for the future .
the electronicain industry only had a dozen different components , and look at the diversity that &apos;s come out of that .
we are mostly limited by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques because of fast synthesemethoden to do so @-@ called combination genomics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
if you think about the processing of 20 million different genes , or trying to optimize processes to make octaan or produce drugs , new vaccines , we can change with a small team , we can do more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just standard selection .
we can select for lifestyle , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on .
this is a sharp image of some real design software that we &apos;re working on , so that you can actually go on and design a new species on the computer .
we don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to look like .
we know exactly how their genetic code looks like .
we now focus on fourth generation of fuels .
recently , you &apos;ve seen grain to ethanol just a bad experiment .
we have second and third generation of fuels that will soon be coming soon as sugar , to more high @-@ surface fuels like octaan or different types of butanol .
but the only way we think that biology can have great influence without making the food peacefully higher and reduce the availability when we start with co2 as its food supply , and therefore we &apos;re designing cells that do it in that way , and we think we can have the first fourth generation of fuels within about
sunlight and co2 is a method--but through our global discoveries , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about 2.5 kilometers deep , in cooking temperatures .
it makes methane from co2 using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we &apos;re able to take co2 , which is easy by pipes can be transported to factories , where that co2 is returned to fuel , to send this process .
&quot; so , in a short period of time , we think we &apos;re able to expand the basic question , &quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really have , you know--the humble targets have to replace petrochemical industry .
yeah. if you can &apos;t do this at ted , where are you ?
become an important source of energy .
but we &apos;re also working on using these tools to come up with rapid series vaccines .
this year , there was the flu , and we always walk something behind the facts when it comes to the right vaccine .
and i think that can change that by making a decombineed vaccines .
here you can see what the future can look like because the evolution is going to change now , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archea , and eventually eukaryota .
we &apos;re far away from improving people .
our goal is to make sure that we make a chance to survive long enough to do that. thank you .
what i want to show you as first , fast is the foundation of a new technology that we brought to a recording to microsoft about a year ago. this is seedragon .
and it &apos;s an environment in which you can get local or distance with immense amounts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at a lot of gigabytes of digital images , and we &apos;re able to stay in and zoom in and navigate , and they &apos;re able to navigate our wish .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collective or pictures are .
most of these are normal digital camera photos , but this one is a scan of the library of congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 megapixel .
it doesn &apos;t matter because the only thing would affect the performance , in a system like this , is the amount of pixels on the screen .
it &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
this is a completely book , an example of non @-@ image data .
this is the gray house through dickens. every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really text , and no image , we can do something like this , to show that this is really text ; this is not a picture .
maybe this is a somewhat strange way to read an e @-@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic example. this is an expression of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of part .
this really gives you fun and the experience of a real paper magazine magazine or newspaper , which is actually a scaling medium .
we &apos;ve also done something with the corner of this outcome of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a fake ad of high resolution--much higher than a normal ad--and we &apos;ve built extra information .
if you want to see the possibilities of this car , you see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and these ideas can really make sure that we can do the limitations of action through the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean a pop @-@ ups more and other flauwekuls--it &apos;s not going to be necessary .
of course , land maps are one obvious application for a technology like this , i won &apos;t spend time here , except that we can contribute to this field too .
these are all roads in the u. s .
placed up a picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s look at something else .
this is now live on the web ; you can look at it .
this project is called photosynth , which connects two techniques together .
one of them is seadragon , and the other is a very nice piece of computer vision research by noah snavely , promovendus at the university of washington , trained by steve vanz on u. w .
and rick szeliski at microsoft research. it &apos;s a beautiful collaboration .
so this is live on the web. it &apos;s sort of made by seadragon .
when we do this , you see , that we experience through the images and the multi @-@ resolution .
the spatial disk of the images has meaning here .
the computer vision algorithms have brought together these images , so that they correspond to the real space--the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies--where they &apos;re taken. so you can see the elements ofstabilised diashows or panorama images , and all of these things are spatial
i &apos;m not sure if there &apos;s time , showing other environments .
there are many more spatials .
i &apos;d like to show one of noah &apos;s original data sets--and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we got working this summer--to communicate what i have in my head is the actual power of this technique , looking at the environments on our website .
we had to take the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstructive of the notre dame with images from flickr. you just search notre dame in flickr , and you get images of people in t @-@ shirts , and the campus and things like that .
and each of these orange clubs gives you an image again that is part of this model .
and so these are all flickr images , which are spatially linked in this way .
and we can navigate simplely .
you know , i never thought i was going to work with microsoft .
it &apos;s overwhelmingly overwhelmed here .
i believe you can see that these are many types of cameras : everything from cell phones to mirrorreflex cameras , a large number of them , put together in this environment .
i &apos;ll try to find some strange images .
there &apos;s so much covered by faces and things like that .
somewhere in this room , even a series of photographs--here they are .
this is even a poster of the notre dame , which is also approved by the program .
if we go through the poster through it , in a physical picture of this environment .
what we want to say with this is that we can really do things with the social environment. this is now using the data of everybody--of the whole collective memory of how , on the vision , the earth looks like it--and buy everything together .
all of these photos are united , and shapes together a whole bit larger than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that &apos;s coming from all over the earth .
see this as a sequel of stephen lawler &apos;s work , the virtual earth .
and this is something that grows in complexity when people use it , and the benefits are growing for the people who use it .
their own pictures are introduced from meta @-@ data that someone else &apos;s transported .
if somebody would like to click all of these areas and put their names , then my photograph of notre dame is enforced with all of that data , and then i can then use it as a access to that space , that meta @-@ addict , using everybody &apos;s pictures , and create a kind
and of course , the bee product of this is an immense rich virtual model of any interesting place on earth , which is not just from aerial pictures , satellite images and other applications , but also from the collective memory .
thank you very much .
chris anderson : have i understood that what makes your software possible , one day , over the years , in the next few years , all the images that are shared by everybody else around the world ?
baa : yeah. what this really is doing is discovering .
it creates , to your wish , hyperlinks between images .
and it does that based on the data in the images .
and it &apos;s extremely exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information about which many of these images are about .
when you search for images , you feel a search for searching , and the text on the web page contains a lot of information about what the image is .
what if that image is linked to all your pictures ?
and then the number of underlinge semantic connections and the amount of wealth that comes out there is huge. it &apos;s a classroom network .
ca : blaise , that &apos;s really incredible. congratulations .
one of the intense pleasure of travel and etnography is the ability to live between them who are not forgotten the old habits , who are still feeling their past in the wind , touching it in the rain @-@ controlled stones , the trials of bitter plants .
the science that jaguar @-@ shamans are still traveling beyond the galaxy , or that the myths of inuit @-@ olders still climbed with meaning , or that in the himalayan buddhists still in the breath of dharma , you really remember the revelation of the ant
the consequence of an accidental set of adaptations that made our ancestors generations ago .
of course , we all share the same adaptability : being born. get kids in the world .
we all make inwijdingsrites .
interact with the inconvenience of death .
so it can &apos;t be a surprise that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interestingly , the unique stuff of the song and the dance rhythm of dance in every single different culture .
whether that &apos;s about the penan in the forests on borneo , or the voodoo ac oils in haiti , or the battles in the kaisut desert in north kenya , the curandero in the andes &apos;s mountains , or the trailer sharks in the heart of the
everest , the goddess mother of the world .
they &apos;re all learning that we can all be different , differently , can make us intervene on earth .
if you think about it , this idea can only give you hope .
together , the awesome cultures in the world form a web of spiritual life and cultural life that makes the planet , and for her , it &apos;s as important as the biological life web , the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural life web as a etnosphere .
the etnosphere you can define as the total of all thoughts , dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that have been banned by human imagination since the beginning of our consciousness .
the etnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
she &apos;s the symbol of all of us and all that we can be , astonishing curious species .
just as the biosphere is observing , the etnosphere is also--and much larger degree .
no biologist would say that at least half of the species are at the point of extinction , because that simply isn &apos;t true .
and that , the most apocalptic scenario is not even near the most optimistic scenario for cultural diversity .
the best indicator of this is the loss of languages .
when everybody was born here , six thousand languages were spoken on earth .
a language is more than her vocabulary or her grammar rules .
one language is a reef of human soul .
it &apos;s the vehicle that allows the soul of any unique culture to the material world .
every language is an eternal mental forest , a separation , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual opportunities .
and of those six thousand languages today , half of them are not horrified half of them in childhood .
they &apos;re no longer taught babies .
that means that , unless they &apos;re a change , they &apos;re already dead .
is there something a lonely than being used by silence , the last of your people to be speaking , to be a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors by giving whether to see the promises of the children ?
precisely , somebody &apos;s pleased condition is any two weeks on earth anywhere , because every two weeks , there &apos;s a older dies , and with him , the last letterstorm of an old language .
&quot; some of you say , &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be better place if we all talk about the same language ? &quot; &quot; i say , &quot; &quot; super , let &apos;s take yoruba. or kantonees . &quot;
&quot; or cook . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll suddenly realize what it wouldn &apos;t be like to speak to your own language . &quot;
so what i &apos;d like to do today is take you on a short journey through the etnosphere , which has to sketch a picture of what &apos;s lost .
&quot; many of us forget that when i talk about &quot; &quot; a different way of his &quot; &quot; i mean quite different ways . &quot;
for example , this barasana child in the north amazon , the people of the anaconda , which believes that they &apos;re coming out of power the milky river , from the east , in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people that &apos;s not cognitively distinguishing the colors blue and green , because it &apos;s the hacking of the sky equals the big forest , where the people depend on .
they &apos;ve got an exciting language and marriages called linguistic exogamia : you have to marry somebody talking about another language .
this has its roots in the mythological past , but the special volts in their homes , where six or seven languages are spoken by these cuiselings marriages , but you never hear a language .
they simply listen and start speaking .
one of the fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve lived with , the waorani in northeast ecuador , a amazing people that became contact in 1958 peaceful .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to contact contact , but they made a critical mistake .
from the air , they were running pictures of himself--to our idea friendly gestures , where they forgot that this people had never seen a two @-@ dimensional picture .
they put up the pictures , and they tried to find the shape behind the face .
and when they didn &apos;t find anything , they concluded that the devil were called them with them , and then the missionaries were running through the missionaries .
but the waorani by booms not just outside , but also each other .
54 percent of their death rates came out of candles .
we could trace genealogies to eight generations , where we found two cases of natural death .
and when we got frozen , they gave that a man ever died of old age , and then he was just wandering. but at the same time they had an amazing sharp knowledge of the big forest .
their hun hunters could smell urine at 40 , remotely , and tell what species it was .
early &apos; 80s , i got an amazing assignment , when my professor asked me if i wanted to go to haiti to infiltrate secret genomes that formed the basics of the power of president duvalier as well as his presidential elitecorps , and so it &apos;s safe to make safe from
to understand some of these sensational things , i had to learn something about this particular belief of vodoun , which is not a cult of black magic .
it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview , very interesting .
would i ask you to call the great world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , etc .
a continent is always connected outside , from the premise that africa had no religion belief , of course , the sahara had no religion .
voodoo is simply the destilled of these profound religious ideas , spread in the tragic diaspora during slavery .
what makes voodoo so interesting is the living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living people have the mind .
the minds can be adapted from underneath the great water , responding to the dance fingers that the soul of living is temporarily , so that in that one wonderful moment , the excuse moment is as the god gets .
&quot; and that &apos;s why voodooiss like to say , &quot; &quot; you guys go to church and talk about god . &quot;
&quot; we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot; &quot; and because you &apos;re so obsessed with mind , what can you happen ? &quot;
this leads to an amazing slow : voodoo followers in trance that paid punish coal .
this reward is demonstrating the possibility of mind to influence the body when it &apos;s extreme .
from all the people i &apos;ve ever lived with , the kogi is the most extraordinary , a people from northern colombia .
deposites of the tairona civilization , which have ever populated the caribbean coast of colombia in the aftermath of aging .
and they went back into a isolated volcanic massive massive that &apos;s over the coast area .
in one of the blood pioneered continent , only this people was never obsolete by the spaniard .
and they &apos;re still transferred by ritual priests , but the training to priest is pretty special .
the young ac oils are taken away from their families when they &apos;re three or four .
they &apos;re in a world of darkness , in stone huts on feet of glaciers for 18 years .
two period of nine years , unconsciously chosen to mimic the nine months of form that they spend in the lap of their mother .
now they &apos;re in wisely speaking in the lap of the great mother .
all of this time , they &apos;re brought together the civil values , values that carry the assumption that only their prayers can keep the cosmic balance .
this is the case that ends up with the day that they &apos;re going to get outside , and for the first time in their life , when they &apos;re 18 , they &apos;re seeing a sunrise. that &apos;s the bright point of consciousness of the first light , when the sun &apos;s the slope of the
you see ? it &apos;s like me told you .
&quot; it &apos;s so beautiful. it &apos;s to protect you this . &quot; &quot; they call themselves the older brothers . &quot;
we are the younger brothers , which are responsible for the destruction of the world .
at this point , the intuitions are very important .
when we think about indigenous people and landscape , we often get rousseau , and we wanted to get the old fabelt of the edele , an idea that is racist in his simplicity .
or we get thoreau and say these people are closer to earth than we are .
indigenous peoples are not sentimental , nor shattered by nostalgia .
for both of you , very little space in the malaria @-@ swamps of the asmat or in the iron winds of tibet , they have been infected by time and rituals , a traditional mystical of the earth , which is not on the idea of being conscious dense , but in a
what does that mean ? it means that a little kid from the andes , which has grown up to believe that the mountain is a monkey @-@ minded mind that will be or its destiny , a fundamental person will be a different relationship to that ground or that place than a little kid from montana ,
whether it &apos;s the root of a mind or a lot of horses , it &apos;s irrelevant .
interestingly , the metaphor that defining the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia with the idea that these forests were there to be cute .
that made me another human than my friends of the kwagiulth , who believe that those forests are the cubicplaats of kuxwhukw and the cracked strings of the sky and the obese minds that walk around the north of the world .
these minds matter during their hamatsa sequence .
if you start with the idea that these cultures can create different reality , you start to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. take this plant .
it &apos;s a picture i took april jl. in the north amazon .
this is ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive bears from the repertoire of the shaman .
what makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not just the pharmacist potential of it , but how thought it is. it &apos;s built out of two sources .
and on the one hand , there &apos;s a wooden liane that pays beta @-@ carboline , harmine and harmaline , and light hallucinate works .
if you only take the plant , it looks like a blue smoke of puzzle is floating by your consciousness .
the plant becomes gemixt with leaves from a coffee @-@ like , psychotria viridis .
the plant wears powerful tryptamines , closely related to brain tutor , dimethyltryptamine , five @-@ methoxydimethyltryptamine .
have you ever seen the yanomami if they &apos;re that , that substance of different species that contains methoxydimethyltryptamine ?
that powder of your nose , when you get out of a rifle , it &apos;s painted with barokke images , to land on a sea of electricity. this doesn &apos;t create a distortion of reality ; it scrambles the reality .
i tried to convince my professor , richard evan shultes--a man who did the psychedelic era by his discovery of paddo &apos;s in mexico in the 1930s .
i learned that these trymines were not to identify as a hallucinate , because when the effect does intimate , nobody has any more home to experience the hallucination. tryptamines are not supposed to be orange because they &apos;re losing by a enzyme in the human gut channel : monopoly .
they can only be ingenuity with something that the monopoly of its effect .
the fascinating thing is that the beta carbolines in the lian are the benodile monopoly suppressed to activate the tryptamine. imagine the question : how can this people find this people in a flora of 80 , 000 plant species two morphysical species , which combined
&quot; we say , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is as a meaningless thing . &quot;
&quot; the indians say , &quot; &quot; the plants talking to us . &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; the tribe , the cofan , know 17 varieties of ayahuasca , that they can identify all the big distance , who would be like a species . &quot;
&quot; if you ask them how they map their taxonomy , they say , &quot; &quot; i thought you knew something of plants . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; &quot; i said no . &quot;
and it turns out , you can hear all 17 species in a night at full moon in different strainrs .
you don &apos;t taste with harvard , but it &apos;s a piece of engaging than counting .
now , the problem is that even those of us who are sympathic versus indigenous peoples , seeing them as curious and colorful , but have helped a footnote in history while the real world , meant our world .
the truth is that the 20th century in 300 years will not be reminded of its wars , or his technological innovations , but rather when the age of time we were standing there , or actively seen or passively looked at the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet. the problem is not
all cultures have always increased a dance of new life economy .
technology is not the problem .
the sioux indians don &apos;t stop being sioux , when they spend their arrows and angry , just as minute as americans stopped americans , when they hire their horse and carve .
it &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the etnosphere. it &apos;s power .
the w peace face of the control .
wherever you look in the world , you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s not the fate of these cultures to disappear .
these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is being taken by identity forces that travel beyond their adaptable opportunities .
or this is now about the huge deforestation in the homeland of the penan , a nomadic southeast @-@ asian people that lived to the previous generation in the forest , and now it &apos;s gotten to the service of services and prostitution to the rivers , where you can see that the river
to fill their ships with trees from the forest .
in the case of yanomami , the diseases that have come in as a result of the discovery of gold .
or if we go to the tibetan mountains , where i do a lot of research , you see the cruel face of political control .
genocide , the physical eradication of a people &apos;s people is convicted , but etnocide , the destruction of a people &apos;s lifestyle is not only not only convicted , but in many areas even being celebrated as part of a development strategy .
the pain of tibet is not to contain , until you touch it on the base level .
i &apos;ve spent a young colleague of kilometer about land from chengdu in west china to lhasa .
it wasn &apos;t until i came in lhasa , i understood the face behind the statistics that you hear about .
6 , 000 sacred monuments destroyed , 1.2 million people killed during the cultural revolution .
my colleague &apos;s father was known to the panchen lama .
and based on that , he was killed directly when the chinese invasion started .
his uncle flight with the dalai lama in the diaspora , who brought people into nepal .
his mother was captured because she was rich .
he was incarcerated the prison when he was two , he &apos;s hidden under her skies , because she couldn &apos;t do without him .
the sister who was so brightly smelld in a cook of education .
one day , she got on an accident on an armband of mao. for this transmit , she got seven years of dwangar labor .
the pain of tibet can be shallow , but the liberation mind of the people is something to crack you .
eventually it comes down to a choice .
do we want to live in a gray world of atonity life , or do we want to embrace a colorful world of diversity ?
the great anthropologist margaret mead said for her death that she feared that we are towards a general , amorf worldview .
we would not only see the human imagination be limited to a flaw , modaal denkkader , but we would also be able to unravel and forget that there are other options .
we can feel humble with the idea that our species is only about $ 150 , 000 years on earth .
the neolitic revolution , who gave us agriculture , where we &apos;re spending the cult of the seed , when the shaman poetry was replaced by the proza of the priesters , and we got an overt by specialization only 10 , 000 years ago .
modern industrial world is not 300 years old .
this surface history doesn &apos;t give me the idea that we have all the answers on all the problems that will come to the next millennia on our path .
if the unfortunate cultures of the world is asked for the meaning of human beings , they answered with 10 , 000 different voices .
and it &apos;s in that song that we will find again the ability to be what we are : a full @-@ conscious species , which allows everything to get all the people and all gardens. there are grand moments of optimism .
this photograph i &apos;ve taken on the northern point of baffin island , when i went hunting in the brakes of narym .
this man , olayuk , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government hasn &apos;t always been friendly for the inuit. in the 1950s , they were , in order to get our sovereignty , placed in settlement .
the grandfather of olayuk refused to go .
the family feared for his life , and he took his weapons , all his tools .
now you have to understand that the inuit weren &apos;t afraid of the cold ; they made use of it .
the glij ice of their snails were originally made of fish in kariboehuid .
olayuks opa wasn &apos;t scared for the poolnacht , or the storm that raasde .
he went out , he left his pants of seals and poepte in his hand. when the poop began to freeze , he formed it as a limb .
he brought a little layer of speek on the side of the knife .
and when it was solid , he slaughtered a dog .
he unfolded the dog and improvise a harness .
from the ribcage he made a sledge .
he was looking for a dog near the ice area , including poops .
talking about nothing left. and this , in many ways , is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all indigenous peoples in the world .
in april 1999 , the canadian government gave the full way back from a piece of land larger than california and texas together , it &apos;s our new home. it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s independent area. they manage all the resources .
it &apos;s an amazing example of how a nation @-@ state disorder can offer to her people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s clear , at least for those of you who &apos;ve traveled to these corners of the world , they &apos;re not quite far away at all .
they &apos;re somebody &apos;s homeland .
they &apos;re for doubting the human imagination , which go back to the beginning of the time. and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , will be part of ours , are part of a unintended geography of hope .
what we &apos;re doing at national geographic is the idea that politicians never reach .
we think that pole peaks--we think that a pole chemistry doesn &apos;t persuade , but we believe that stories can change the world , which means we &apos;re probably the best storyteller in the world. our website is going to be 35 million times a month , we &apos;re in 156 countries on tv
we &apos;re making a lot of simplicity traveling to the etnosphere , with our audience , to such special cultural places , where the nurse is so empowered by what he &apos;s seeing , so hopefully a brick will embrace the most important epiphany epidemic of the anthro
where all the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well @-@ being .
thank you very much .
i want to talk to you about some of the problems that i &apos;ve gone through recently a book .
you might see parallels with information from other sources .
i &apos;m also trying to explain some relationships that you might have missed .
&quot; i want to start with the &quot; &quot; official dogma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be precise , the official dogma of all western , industrialized societies .
and that official dogma says , to get the prosperity of our citizens at the highest level , we need to give them so many individual freedom as well .
freedom is a big good , a essential part of the human existence .
moreover , liberty allows us to act to act on their own insight , to achieve a higher prosperity of prosperity without third--
the ultimate freedom we find in choice .
more choices in that people have more freedom .
and more freedom means automatically prosperity .
this is so deeply rooted in our society that nobody wouldn &apos;t doubt .
and in our lifetime , this dogma is solidly accurate .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of our modern choice .
this is my supermarket. it &apos;s a medium medium .
let &apos;s talk about dressings .
in addition to that 175 side and--and my supermarket , there are 10 different brands of extra @-@ virgin olive oil and 12 different balsamicos available .
and you can make your countless own dressings , for the case between those 175 species for you .
so that &apos;s the supply of my supermarket .
look at electronics stores. you can put your stereoset together--loudspeakers , cd player , cassette players , radio , amplify .
you can choose from this number .
you can put six @-@ and @-@ half million different systems together with parts of that store .
give you a lot--you have a lot of choice .
another example--communication .
when i was young , long ago , you could ask all kinds of phones , but just ma bell .
you rent the device. you didn &apos;t buy it .
that was the advantage that the device never went .
that time is over .
today , there are lots of different devices .
especially in mobile phones , the diversity of diversity is .
these are the cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle--that with mp3 player , neushaarknipper and creme bruleebrander .
maybe you haven &apos;t seen this model yet , but you can make sure that happens soon .
the consequence : people come to the store and ask this question .
and you know how the answer to that question is that ?
no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
also , in aspects of life that are much more important than the scale of stuff , this explosive increase of choices .
health care--in the u. s . , it &apos;s not that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and that tells you what to do .
&quot; no , you go to the doctor , and they say , &quot; &quot; we can do a , or we can do b . &quot;
a has this for @-@ and thinking .
&quot; b has this for @-@ and down. what do you want ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; doctor , what do you find ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; a has this for @-@ and @-@ disadvantage , and b has this for @-@ and @-@ down . &quot;
&quot; what do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; doctor , if you were me , what would you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and then we call it &quot; &quot; self @-@ interrupt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that sounds very positive , but in fact , that the heavy task of decision @-@ making decisions shift from somebody with sense of things--the doctor--to a look , somebody who &apos;s virtually sick and hasn &apos;t got the best conditions to make decisions--the patient. for recipe
well , well , you know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos; t
why make advertising , if we can &apos;t buy them ?
because they think that the next morning we &apos;re going to call our doctor to ask for that other brand drug .
our identity , yet a profound aspect of our existence , is now delivered to choices , as you can see on this slide .
our identity is from our background .
we find ourselves--so often we want to .
every morning you have to think about what kind of person you want to be .
let &apos;s talk about marriage , the family .
there &apos;s been a time that virtually everybody automatically automatically went on that you could get married so fast , and then started as fast as kids .
the only actual choice was with whom , not when and what you did .
now it &apos;s almost everything for theraping .
i teach in particular intelligent students , which i spend 20 percent less homework than i used to .
they &apos;re not dumb or louder than in the earlier times .
no , they have the pressure with choices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; will i marry or not ? am i going to marry ? &quot;
&quot; or will i wait for that ? do i take kids , or a career ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are all kinds of questions .
they go through until they have an answer , even if this means that they don &apos;t get all their homework , and they don &apos;t get any right number .
and they &apos;re right. they &apos;re important questions .
and then we come to work. so carl gave us that technology allows us to work every minute of every single day , where in the world--except in the randolph hotel .
by the way , there &apos;s a place , which i love secret , where wifi does it .
i don &apos;t explain where , because i want to keep that place for me .
but all right , that massive choice of work is that we &apos;re still wondering about , again , again , again , we &apos;re wondering , whether we &apos;re working now , or not .
we can look at a football game of our son , with our cell phone on the one hand , and our blackberry on the other hand , and maybe our laptop on laptop .
&quot; and even if they &apos;re all out , we &apos;re going to have every minute of those competition with all kinds of questions : &quot; &quot; am i going to answer this phone call ? &quot;
&quot; will i respond to this email ? am i going to write this letter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and even if the answer is &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; we experience the soccer game of our son in a very different way . &quot;
wherever we look at , the big , small , materialistic things , lifestyle : life is a question of choose .
that &apos;s how the world used to look like .
there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choose .
and this is what the world looks like .
the question now is , is this good or bad ?
&quot; the answer is , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
that huge choice of choice has two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a very contradiction of effect is that it &apos;s more likely to be paralyzed than liberated .
with so many choices , people find it hard to make a choice .
i &apos;m going to give you a very dramatic example of this , a study to investment in voluntary pension plans .
a colleague of mine got access to investment data fromguard , a great investors with about a million employees spread over 2 , 000 vests .
and they found that for every 10 investors , the employers who offered the employer , the participation took two percent .
at five degrees , ten percent of them did 10 percent of the employees in the work of five funds. why ?
because it &apos;s so hard to choose that people just put the choice into the next day , and those on that , and so on and so forth .
and of extinction comes off .
it doesn &apos;t only mean that those people after their pensionering don &apos;t have a drought bread because they didn &apos;t put enough money on the side , but also that the choice was extremely difficult that they have shooting the employer advantage .
and they dropped up to 5 , 000 dollars a year on their nose .
the employer was willing to double their own contribution .
so too many choices can work paralyzing .
and i think the world looks like this .
when it comes to the eternal , you really want to make the right choice , right ?
you don &apos;t want to sit down with the wrong fund , or even the wrong dressing .
that &apos;s the first effect. the second effect is that we also , if we &apos;re paralyzed the paralysis of ourselves and choose , eventually being less satisfied with the outcome than it would be the case if we had less options .
and there are multiple reasons for that .
one of them is that there &apos;s a choice , for example , from countless dressings , it can see that the choice was not perfect .
you &apos;re in such a case that a different choice would have been better .
this little alternative causes you get regret from your choice .
and regret is regreted to the followers of the choice you &apos;ve made , even if it was a good choice .
the more options are there , it &apos;s too easy to have regret of any element of the chosen option .
a second reason has done with substitutiekosts .
and then , of course , this morning , yes , was , how often we let the value of things off of the things that we compare them to .
and if you can imagine many alternatives , even though you can see the attractive sides of all the alternatives that you &apos;re coming down .
that makes you happy with the alternative you &apos;ve chosen .
an example. for the non @-@ new yorkers underneath you , my excuses .
this is a little bit of the stream of this example .
this is on vacation in the hamptons .
they have expensive second wound .
they &apos;re on a wonderful beach. they &apos;re running again. they &apos;re not human beings .
&quot; right ? &quot; &quot; deserve , &quot; &quot; think that man , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s august . &quot;
everybody in my neighborhood in manhattan is the city .
&quot; i could park my car for the door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he &apos;s sitting there two weeks there , with the idea that he &apos;s missing a great parking street every day .
substitutiekosts go at the cost of the followers we have of our choice , even if we make a great choice .
the more opportunities there are , the more attractive alternatives are there .
and they present to us as substitutions .
another example .
this image story is touched to some of the points .
life in here and for example , and you don &apos;t have to overwhell things .
one more point is that you &apos;re locking out with every choice of other choices .
and all of that other has so attractive sides , which makes the elected option less attractive .
and thirdly , there &apos;s the escalation of expectations .
and i came up here during my quest to a new pants .
i &apos;m wearing almost always spades .
it used to be only one sort of spy stroke , and it bought you. it didn &apos;t fit , it was incredibly uncomfortable , but if you wore the pants long enough and often enough waste , it felt ok .
after years , i went to the store for a new store .
&quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; day , i want a spongy stroke , this is my measure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the store said , &quot; &quot; do you want smart fit , easy fit or relaxed fit ? &quot;
do you want nodes or a ride ? do you want stone washed or acid @-@ washed ?
do you want a slime with slime effect ?
&quot; you want to get some pipe pipes , or crazy pipes . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s how it went . &quot;
&quot; i was unexpected. after a while , i said , &quot; &quot; i want the only pants that used to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had no idea what pants that was , and so i &apos;ve fit all the potential bread .
honestly , i finally left the store with a excellent fit .
i did better. all of those possibilities , i could do it better .
but i didn &apos;t feel better .
why ? to explain this to myself , i wrote a book .
the reason i didn &apos;t feel better with all of those choices , was that i started to expect more from the snit of a good speech .
i began without any expectation , because i &apos;ve only known a little bit of a clue .
and then it turned out to be different , and one of them would be perfect .
what i bought was good , but not perfect .
and so i compared my pants with my expectations , and that made me teleur .
the more possibilities of people have , the more expectations they are expecting about making those possibilities .
and that means that people are less satisfied with results , even if the results are good .
marketing people don &apos;t know this .
because in that case , you didn &apos;t know where i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s about something like this .
everything was better when everything was worse .
because when everything was worse , people could have even more surprising experiences .
in our modern society , we as well as prosperous citizens , we can expect perfection , but the best thing we &apos;ve ever been able to achieve is that something is so good when we expected .
never surprised , because our expectations , my expectations , are towerless .
the secret of happiness--this is all you had--the secret to happiness is not too much expected .
i want to ask here--let &apos;s say a carbiografic element--that i &apos;m married with a woman who &apos;s really great .
i didn &apos;t ask her with her with less satisfied .
but with less pleasure , it has good sides .
and finally , when you buy a bad crack , if there &apos;s only one kind of fit , you can wonder why you &apos;re disconnected .
the answer is simple in that case .
the world is responsible. because you didn &apos;t have any choice .
but if there are hundreds of different clinics available , and you buy one that turns out , who is responsible ?
the answer to that is just as simple. that &apos;s you .
you could make a better choice .
you don &apos;t have any excuse to fail .
so when people decide , even though the results of decisions are good , they &apos;re disappointed about their choice .
and they take them to angry .
in the western society , clinical depression under the younger generations high .
a factor--not the only thing , but a significant factor at this explosive increase of depression and suicide is that people have so often disappointing experiences because of their high expectations .
and if they try to explain that disappointment for themselves , they blame itself .
so the netultaat is that we &apos;re going to move objectively forward , but we feel worse .
let me give you a sense .
this is the official dogma , which corresponds to everybody .
but it &apos;s not .
it doesn &apos;t doubt that can choose better than they can &apos;t choose , but it doesn &apos;t follow automatically that more choice is even better .
there &apos;s a magic border of choice opportunities. which one , i don &apos;t know .
but i do know that we &apos;ve been at the very point for a long time that choice freedom is creating our well @-@ being .
now , there &apos;s a principle--i &apos;m almost done--one principle that we can love the best .
the choice in industrialized countries comes from material abundance .
there are lots of places in the world , we &apos;ve heard about that earlier , where the problem is not so much that there is too much choice , but it &apos;s too little choice .
so the paradox that i &apos;m discussing here is particularly the modern , prosperous west .
that &apos;s frustrating , and here &apos;s why , steve levitt told you yesterday that expensive and hard to install don &apos;t help your children &apos;s money .
i &apos;m going to tell you the same thing about this expensive , complex choices--they don &apos;t help. worse , they focus damage .
they make our lives worth less .
if some of the people in our society allows us to make all those choices were transmitted to countries where people have too little options , the life of those people would move forward .
our life would also move forward .
that &apos;s what economists call a pareto improvement .
everybody &apos;s better off by prosperity of wealth--not just poor people--and it &apos;s because of the burden of choice that we &apos;re dealing with .
&quot; and finally this. if you read this image story , you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; ah , what do you know about it ? &quot;
&quot; nothing is possible in a fishnkom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a schral imagination , a short view of worldview--that was my first interpretation .
but the longer i thought about it , the more i understood that this fish is the same smart thing .
because in fact , this is going on : if you break the fishnkom to create opportunities , you have no freedom , but paralysis .
if you break the fishnkom to create opportunities , you become less satisfied .
it leads to more paralysis and less satisfaction .
everybody needs a fishnkom .
this one is almost definitely limited--even for the fish , but certainly for us .
but the absence of a figureless fishnkom is questions about miserable , and , forgive , unheil .
thank you for your attention .
