several years ago, here at ted, petere skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge.
and the idea is very simple.
groups of four people have to build the highest tower as possible, using 20 spaghettis, a meter of sticks, a meter of spago and a marshmallow.
marshmallow has to be squared at the top of the tower.
and, even though it looks very simple, it's actually quite difficult, because it's forced people to collaborate very rapidly.
so i thought it was an interesting idea, and i embedded it in a lab on design.
and it was a huge success.
and since then, i organized about 70 design labs of this kind of thing around the world with students and designers and architects, even searching for fortune 50 companies.
there's something in this exercise that reveal important lessons on nature of collaboration, and i'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
normally, most people start with the orientation to the task.
they talk about it, they imagine that it might look like it might be, they buy power, then they spend time planning, organizing.
they make sketches and they predispose spaghetti.
they spent most of the time available by assembleing spaghettis in crescent structures, and finally, just when the time is about to die, somebody pulls out the marshmallow, and they fall over the top, they take a step back and ta-da!
they admire the work.
" but what's actually happening, most of the time, is that the" " ta-da" " turns into a" " uh-oh, " " because the weight of marshmallow makes folds and collapses the whole structure. "
" there's a number of people who have a lot more" " uh-oh" " than others, and amongst the worst of the worst of business school. "
they lie, they cheat, they distract, and they create absolutely discount structures.
" and there are naturally groups that have many more ta-da structures, and, among the best, there are babies of childhood schools. "
and it's amazing.
as peter says, they don't just create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
and your question will be: how is it possible? why? what particular do they do?
" and peter loves that, " " no one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of spaghetti. " " right. "
they didn't spend time competeing power.
but there's another reason.
and the reason is that the students in economics are formed to find the single best project.
and then do it.
and after, what happens is that when they put marshmallow on top, they don't have time, and what's going on?
crisis.
sounds familiar? right.
what children do differently, is that they start from marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the other, always holding the marshmallow, and so many possibilities of addictable prototyping along the way.
designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the iterative process.
and with each version, children have instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work.
so the ability to work on prototypes is essential, but let's see how many groups work.
the average for most people is about 50 centers, for the students of economics, about half, lawyers, a little better, but not much, children, better than most adults.
who's better than everyone?
architects and engineers, thanks to the sky.
99 cm is the highest structure i've ever seen.
and why? because they understand that triangoli and authoritarian models are the key to build structures.
then we have the general directries, a little better than the average.
but here's where it becomes interesting.
if you include a ceo, the group can do much better.
" it's amazing. you go a little bit around, you look, " " you'll see that group win. " " you can understand in advance. and why? "
because they have particular ability to make the work altrui.
they run the process, they understand it.
and all the groups who are running and praying attention to work better than the outcome of the team.
special doctors and reputation workers, and their combination leads to a safe success.
if you've got 10 groups that usually work well, you may have maybe you're going to get structures that are standing.
and i tried an interesting experiment.
i thought, let's raise the mail for once.
i put 10, 000 dollars in software software in the vincente team.
what do you think that's happened to design students?
what was the result?
that's what happened.
none of the team has created a stable structure.
if one of them had built a two-inch structure, it would have led to the prize.
isn't it interesting that a high mail has this strong impact?
we tried the exercise again with the same students.
what do you think that's happened?
now they had understood the value of a prototype.
the same team, from the worst has become the best.
they've created the highest structure over time.
so these are important lessons on the nature of incentives and success, you might be wondering, why would someone spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?
the reason is this: help to create digital tools and processes to help groups build cars, video games and visual effects.
and what a marshmallow challenge does is to help identify hidden assumptions.
because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't that?
the challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
and so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
and those of you who are interested, can go to marshmallowchge. com.
it's a blog where you can look at how to build marshmallow.
there are step-step instructions.
there are crazy examples from all over the world about how people are correct and added the system.
there's also the world's record.
and the most important lesson, i think, is that design is really a contact sport.
it requires the employment of all the senses, and the use of reasonable thinking, the feelings and the manuality to deal with the challenge that you have in your hand.
" and sometimes, a little prototype of this experience is all necessary to transform a" " uh-oh" " moment" " at a ta-da moment. " " "
and this can really make a difference.
thank you very much.
we pretend that we have a car, great, beautiful, pure ted style, is a time machine.
everybody in this room has to go.
you can go back, you can go ahead; you can't stay where you are.
and i would be curious to know which you would choose, because i asked my friends over the last time, and everybody wants to go back.
" i don't know. they want to go back to first that there were cars or twitter, or" " american idol. " " "
i don't know.
i'm convinced that there's sort of a return to nostalgia, to illusions.
i understand that.
but i'm not part of that group, i have to admit it.
i don't want to go back, and not because i'm adventurous, and why possibilities on this planet don't come back, go ahead.
so i want to get into the car and want to move forward.
this is the best time that we've been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, wealth, mobility, opportunity, disease rates.
there's never been a time like this.
my great grandparents died, everybody, before the age of 60.
my grandparents pushed that number to 70.
my parents are about to touch 80.
so it's better than there's a nine at the beginning of the number of my age in my death.
but it's not just people like us, it's a much bigger thing than that.
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
think about it. it's an incredible fact.
how does it be true?
smallpox. smallpox killed billions of people on this planet.
it changed the demographics of the globe like no war has ever done.
if it's gone. disappear.
we defeated it. puff.
in the rich world, diseases that were threatening millions of people just a generation ago no longer exist.
you're going to see, rosolia, polio--
does anybody know what they are?
vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumph of scientific method.
and to me, the scientific method, to try things, see if they work, change when they don't work, it's one of the great results of humanity.
these were the good news.
unfortunately, it was the only good news, because there are other problems, and many times, for example, for example, is that, despite all we've gotten, a billion people go to bed hungry on this planet every day.
this number is growing up, incredible rapidity, and it's shame.
and not only, we used our creativity to fill the planet.
drinking water, clean land, rainforests, oil, natural gass: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and if we don't innovate our actions to pull us out of this guaio, we will disappear ourselves.
so the question is: can we do that? i think i can.
i think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people without rapeing the earth that they live on.
i think it's possible to supply this world of energy without destroying it.
i really believe, and no, it's not an illusion.
but here's the thing that keeps me awake at night--one of the things that keep me awake at night.
we've never needed scientific advances like we need now, never, and we've never been in the position of using them at best than we might today.
we are at a step from incredible events, really, in many areas.
but despite that, i think we should go back to centuries, 300 years, before the enlightenment, to find a period where we fought the advances, a period where we fought them more vigorously, and on the front, than we do now.
people are trapped in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of force that we can't liberate them.
even the truth can free them.
listen, everybody has right to their own opinion; they also have right to their opinion on progress, but you know what you haven't got right?
you don't have right to your facts. sorry, you can' t.
and i put a little bit about it.
" a decade ago, i wrote a story about vaccines for" " the new yorker, " " a short article. "
and i was amazed that somebody's opportunities, who was opposite to what it is, after all, the measure of healthier more effective than all human history.
i didn't know what to do, so i did as usual, written the story and went to the other.
not much later, i wrote a story about genetically modified food.
same thing, just bigger.
people were crazy.
" so i wrote a story about that, and i couldn't figure out why people are looking at everyone like" " monsters, " " because they thought that moving molecules specifically, rather than invade nature's field. "
but as i always, i do my job. i wrote the story and i went on.
i mean, i'm a journalist: we write, we send, we go to dinner, ends up there.
but these stories tortured me and i couldn't understand why, but eventually i made it.
the problem was that those fanatics who were making me impatient were not fanatics at all.
they were people of consciousness, educated, good people.
they were just like people in this room.
and the thing was very--
but then i thought, come on, we need to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress there was once.
we talk about it in a ambiguous way.
" we talk about it in ironic terms using virgolette: " " progress" " is ok, there are reasons to do it, and i think we know what they are. "
we've lost trusts in institutions, authority, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable that this happened.
just do some names and people understand.
chernobyl, bhopal, challenger, vioxx, weapons of mass destruction, election tricks.
i mean, everybody has his list.
we have questions and problems with the people we thought were always right.
so be skeptical.
ask questions, demanding answers, demanding evidence.
don't give anything for granted.
but here's the key point: when the evidence come and need to accept them, and we're not very good at this.
and i think the reason for that is that we are in a fear epidemic that i'd never seen and i hope i'll never see.
about 12 years ago, he was published a story, a horrible story, who argued there was a bond between an epidemic of autism and vaccines against measles, parotite and rosolia.
very scary.
hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
and you had to do hundreds of studies; it's an important question.
they finally got the data.
they arrived from the united states, from england, sweden, canada, and everybody was equal, no link, no correlation, nothing.
he didn't make a difference. he didn't do it because we believe anecdotes, what we see--what we think we see, what makes us feel real.
we don't believe that there's no pile of a pile formining documents of government that show us numbers, and i understand that, i think we all understand it.
but you know what?
the results were devastating--
devastating because here's a fact: the united states are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against morbill is warm.
it's terrible, and we should be ashamed of ourselves.
it's terrible.
what happened to us to do something like that?
now, i understand that. i really understand that.
think about it, somebody here has the measles?
anyone in the audience have ever seen a person dying of measles?
it doesn't often happen.
in this country, it doesn't happen, but it happened 160, 000 times in the world last year.
i'm a lot of dead for measles, 20 every hour.
but since it hasn't happened here, we can take away from the head, and people like jenny mccarthy can go around and shoot fear messages and ignorance from stage like oprah or larry king live.
and they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlation.
they don't understand that these two things look equal, but they're almost never.
but it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it fast.
this man was a hero, jonas salk.
he liberated humanity from one of his worst flagellis.
no fear, no suffering--polio, puff--scomparsa.
the man in the middle, not as much.
it's called paul offit.
he simply created a vaccine against the rotavirus together with other people.
he saved 400, 500, 000 children every year in developing countries.
evil, right?
it's great, if it wasn't that paul goes around talking about vaccines, it says how valuable they're valuable and that people should simply stop refined.
and he says it in these terms.
so paul is considered a terrorist.
when paul speaks to a public hearing can't testify without a armed waste.
they call him home because some people like to remind them that know where her children go to school.
why? because paul has created a vaccine.
i wouldn't need to say that, but vaccines are fundamental.
if we stop taking them, diseases come back, terrible diseases, and it's happening.
we've got the measles in this country again.
and it's going to be worse, and not very much children will start dying again because it's just a matter of numbers.
and they're not just going to die of measles.
polio? let's get that. why not?
and one of my former colleague of college wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that he was a little bit excited.
no one told me earlier.
she wouldn't vaccinated her son against polio.
not dead.
okay.
why? because there is no polymer from us. but you know what?
yesterday, we didn't have polio in the united states.
today, i don't know. . . maybe a guy's morning and climbed up a plane in lagos and he's coming to los angeles, now he's over ohio.
maybe it's going to be in a couple of hours, it's going to rent a car, it's going to get here to long beach and tonight to one of these wonderful cene organized by ted.
he doesn't know he's been infected with a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know it because that's how the world works.
this is the planet we live in. we don't pretend it's not like this.
we love surrounded with lies. we love to do it.
all you took the vitamin morning?
bust, a little bit of antioxidants to start the day.
i know you've done it because half of americans do it every day.
they take that stuff, as they rely on alternative medicine, and no matter how often we're going to prove they are useless.
the data always demonstrate it.
they make the darkest urine. more than that doesn't do, almost never.
but that's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars to dark urine, they're with you.
urina dark. dark.
why do we do that? why?
i think i understand, we hate big pharmaceutical houses.
we hate the great government machine. we don't trust it.
and we do good. our healthcare is crap.
it's cruel to millions of people.
and absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing, even for those of us who can afford it.
so let's run away from it, and who are we going to refugee?
we jump across the arms of the great placebo.
it's great. we love the great placebo.
you know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a sketch, and we spend billions of dollars.
i have a whole bunch of examples here.
no one of these--ginkgo--a fraud, a bush--i know--i don't know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a fraud.
" you know what? when i say these things, people scream me against, and they say, " " what do you care? let people do what they want. "
" it makes them good. " " "
guess what? you've wrong.
" because i'm not interested in whether it's the secretary of health and human services to say" " uhm, i'm not going to listen to the evidence of mammography experts, " " or whether it says some moons of cancer that wants to cure patients with coffee. "
when we store the way that leads to science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we don't want to be.
we end up like thabo mbeki in south africa.
he killed 400, 000 of his fellow citizens continuing to say that barbabng, the limon and juice worked better than anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow down last aids.
hundreds of thousands of useless deaths in a country that has been hit more than any disease.
please don't tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
there are. there are always.
now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle right now is the absurd war between the sustainability of genetically modified foods and the elite of biological food.
it's an idiot diatriba. it has to finish.
it's a diatriba on words, metaphors.
it's ideology, it's not science.
every single thing we eat, every rice of rice, every leaf of prezzemolo, every brusset of brussels has been modified by man.
you see, there were no mandarin in the garden of eden.
there were no appreciation.
there were no christmas trees. we created them.
we did that over the last 11, 000 years.
something worked and something else didn' t.
and we eliminated what didn't work.
now we can do it more precisely.
and there are risks, of course there are.
but we can insert things like vitamin to rice, and that would help millions of people, millions of people, prolong their lives.
and don't we want to do that?
i have to tell you, i don't understand that.
we're against everyone else.
why?
the things that i always hear are: too many chemical compounds, pesticides, hormones, monocultures, we don't want huge fields with the same thing, is wrong.
we don't want companies to put patents on life.
we don't want companies to be unique to seed owners.
do you know what my answer to this?
and yes. you're right. let's do something.
it's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
it has nothing to do with science.
and law, morality, patent lines.
you know the science is not a corporation.
it's not a nation.
it's not an idea; it's a process.
it's a process, sometimes by positive results sometimes not, but the idea that we shouldn't afford to science to do his work only because we fear and really scared, and it's preventing millions of people to thrive.
you know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent more than what we produce now, 70 percent.
these are investments in africa for the last 30 years.
shame. shame.
they need them and we don't give them.
why? genetically modified food.
we don't want to encourage people to eat sketches like manioca.
half a billion people eat it.
it looks a little bit like a potato.
but it provides just calories. it's crap.
it doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are finding the way we put together right now.
so many people could eat and run less the risk of becoming blind.
they wouldn't die of hunger, and you know what?
it would be very nice. it wouldn't be a luxury restaurant, but it would be very nice.
i just ask myself, why are we against?
i mean, let's ask you: why are we observing this thing?
just because we don't want to move genes here and there?
it's about shifting genes. it's not chemicals.
it's not our ridiculous obsession for hormones, or our desire to have bigger food, better, easier.
they don't get the rice krispies.
it's about saving people's lives, and it's now that we're starting to understand what it means.
why do you want to know? --if we don't understand it, and we continue to behave ourselves now, we will be guilty of something that i don't think we don't want to macchiae, technology colonialism.
there's no way to describe what's going on.
it's selfish, it's horrible, and in front of us, and we have to stop it.
" so after this funny conversation, you might wonder, " " do you want to get into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future? " " "
yeah! of course i want.
it's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
we can set out the time machine as we want.
we have the chance to make it where we want, and we're going to really go where we want.
we need to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we get into the time machine and we move forward we'll be happy to do it.
i know that we can and, as far as i'm concerned, i think the world needs it immediately.
thank you.
thank you.
one day, the cronista of los angeles times steve lopez was walking around the streets of the middle of los angeles when you hear a beautiful music.
so it came from a man, a african-american man, fascinating, with the treaties, withoutmora, playing a violin that had only two strings.
i'm telling a story that many of you know, because the articles of steve's articles serve for a book, which, later, was adapted to the big screen, with robert downey jr who was offered the part of steve lopez, and jamie foxx in the part
nathaniel left juilliard, had a terrible nervous exhaustive, and 30 years later, he lived like a roof for the streets of skid row in the middle of los angeles.
he invited all of you to read steve's book or watching the film to understand not only the beautiful connection that created between these two men,
my name is jane mcgonigal. i am a video game autrice.
i found online games for 10 years and my goal for the next 10 and trying to make the world to save the world in real life as well as the world of online games.
to do that, i have a plan, and it's about convince more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing more beautiful and interesting games.
at the moment, we spend three billion hours a week playing online.
" some of you might think, " " that's a little bit of time playing. " " "
maybe too long, given how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
in fact, according to my research, at the institution for the future, it's actually true.
three billion hours a week are not sufficient enough to solve the world's most urgent problems.
in fact, i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase more than that number.
i calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of game every week.
it's probably an idea a counterintuitive path, so again, to regulate the concept.
if we want to solve problems which hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity, i think we have to have the ambition to play online, for at least 21 billion hours at the seventh, for the end of the next decade. no, they're serious, really.
that's why. this picture sums up because i think it's so important for the survival of human species. really.
this is a portrait of phil toldan photographer, wanted to capture play emotion.
so he photographed players as they played.
and this is a classic play emotion.
if you're not used players, you can lose some of the nuance of this picture.
you probably notice the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but also a intense concentration, a very deep attention to dealing with a really hard problem.
if you're used, you'll notice some details, the folds around the eyes, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
and inarcate nickname shows surprise.
this is a used to a step from something called a victoria epic.
ah, it's a term you've heard. ok. all right.
so we have some used players between us.
a epic victory is so amazing positive that doesn't seem to be possible until you get it.
it's almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there and a shock to find out what you're really capable of. this is a epic victory.
this player is a step from a epic victory.
and this is the expression that we need to see on the face of millions of solving problems in the world as we face obstacles for the next hundred years. 0 the expression of someone who, against all expectations, is a step from a epic victory.
unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in everyday life as we keep dealing with urgent problems.
" this is the expression called" " i'm not good at reality. " " and i'm me doing it. can you see it? good. "
" i'm like, " " i'm not good at the reality. " " "
this is a graph in my old neighborhood of berkeley, california, where i did phd on why we are better at play than in real life.
and this is a problem of many small players: we feel that in reality we're not as good as games.
" and i don't mean" " good" " just like success, even though success is part of it: we get more results in online worlds. "
but i also mean good at motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
and when we're in a online world, i think many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of helping helplessly praying, the more capable of focusing on a problem for all the time to get back after failure and try again.
and in real life, when we face failure, when we face a hurdle, we often don't feel like this: we feel overwhelmed, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynics.
we're never making these feelings as we play, just don't exist in a game.
so this is what i wanted to study at university.
what is it that in a game that prevents us to feel that we can't get any outcome?
how can we transport those feelings from games and apply them to the real world?
so i studied games like world of warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative ways.
and i started looking at some things that make the epic victories so possible in online worlds.
the first is that, when he appeared in one of these online games, especially in world of warcraft, there's a lot of different characters that trust the point so that he can rely on a mission to save the world. until now.
but not any mission: a perfectly adequate mission to your current level in play. right?
so you can complete it.
never give you an impossible challenge.
but it's at the limit of your capacity. so you have to try seriously.
but there's no unemployed in world of warcraft, you don't spend time turning thumbs, there's always something specific and important to do.
and there's a lot of collaborators.
everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your epic mission.
it's not such a common thing in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
and there's also this epic narrative, this narrative that inspires, why we are there, and what we're doing.
and then we get all this positive feedback--
you've heard about increasing levels and+1 of force, and+1 in intelligence.
we don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
when i leave this stage, i'm not going to have 1 to talk to a audience, it's 1 1 to bizarre ideas.
i don't get that kind of feedback in real life.
now, the problem with collaborative environments online as world of warcraft is that as a lot of satisfaction being a step from a victory epic all the time, that we decide to spend our time in these worlds of play.
it's just better than reality.
that's why, so far, collectively all world of warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth.
this is not necessarily a negative thing.
but let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago it was the time when one of our ancestors stood up.
that was the first primate walkingright.
ok, so when we're talking about how much time we're invest in playing, the only way that we're only thinking about thinking about, is to talk about timing to human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also useful, because we've discovered that by spending all this time
that's true, i think.
so consider this interesting statistic.
it was published recently by a researcher at carnagie mellon university.
the typical middle-day young day in a country with a strong abitual players, will have spent 10, 000 hours playing online, at age 21.
10, 000 hours is a pretty interesting number for two reasons.
first of all, for children in the united states 10.080 hours is the exact number of hours walking to school from fifth elementary to maturity if you're present every day.
so we have an entire parallel education path in which young people learn how to be good players at school in which they learn everything else.
" and some of you will probably have read the new book of malcolm gladwell, " " outside. " " "
if you've done it, you've read about her successful theory, the theory of 10, 000 hours for success.
it's founded on a good study in the field of cognition, which says that if we devote 10, 000 hours of studying every single thing at 21 years we will be genes in that field.
we'll be good at something as much as the best people in the world.
so, what we now have now is a whole generation of young people who are genes of play.
" so the question is, " " exactly what do these players become good? " " "
because if we could figure out what we're going to do, we're going to have a amount of unprecedented human resources.
this is the number of people in the world who spend at least an hour a day to play online.
these are our genes of play.
500 million people who are extraordinary brave--in something.
and in the next decade, we're going to have another billion habitual players that are amazingly good at something.
if you already didn't know it, this is what we're expecting: video game industry is developing platforms that consume little energy and that works with mobile internet instead of the internet broadband internet, so particularly in india, china, brazil, can connect online.
the estimate is a billion players more in the next decade.
this is going to take us to 1.5 billion small players.
so i started thinking about what these games are related to us.
these are four aspects that i detect. the first is a optimism urgent.
okay. think of it as extreme self-motivation form.
a optimism urgent is the desire to act immediately to tackle a hurdle, together with the belief of having a reasonable hope of success.
abitual players always believe that a epic victory is possible is that it's worth trying to try and try and try it now.
the habitual players are not with their hands.
the abitual players are virtues in the tessere a social robusta.
there are many interesting research that show us how we're better with other people after they've played with them, even though they've restricted us.
and the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: we trust that they spend their time with us, that they're going to play with the same rules and with the same goals, and they'll remain to the conclusion of play.
so, play together that actually builds trust and cooperation bonds.
as a result, we have really more robust social relationships.
productivity. i love it.
you know, there's one reason why the average warcraft average player plays 22 hours a week, almost as part-time work.
it's because we know, as we're playing, that we're actually happier working harder, rather than relaxing or losing time.
we know that we're optimistic, as humans, to work hard to something that has meaningful.
and the habitual players are willing to work constantly, if they're given a adaptive task.
finally, a epic meaning.
abitual players love to be associated with wonderful missions, human stories on planetary scale.
for example, a small information to help create context.
you know all wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
the second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80, 000 articles and the wiki of world of warcraft five million people use every month.
they've collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet, that on any other topic in any other wiki in the world.
they're building a epic opera.
they're building a epic source of information about world of warcraft.
okay, these are the four superpowers that together are one thing together.
abitual players are great optimism of super-poteri.
these are people who believe they are individually capable of changing the world.
the only problem is that they believe they're able to change virtual worlds, but not real real.
this is the problem i'm trying to solve.
there's an econom called edward castronova.
his studies are brilliant. he's studying why people invest so long, energy and money, in online worlds.
" he said, " " we're looking at what's less than a mass exotic to virtual worlds and online game environments. " " "
and it's an econom, so it's rational, and it says--not like me, i'm a game designer, i'm exuberant--
but he says--he says that this is a perfectly feeling, because the abitual players can get more in online worlds than in real life.
they can have more social relationships in a game that's not in real life.
they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in a game than not in real life.
so it's said, for now, it's perfectly reasonable for the habitual players, to spend more time in virtual worlds that in the real world, even though i agree that this is reasonable now, but not, in any way, an ideal situation we have to start making the
here is a inspiration from something that happened in the last two years ago.
these are ancient dadi, made of sheep bones before we had joysticks and wonderful pulses, we had pecora bones and these represent the first game tools that are made from humanity.
if you know about the ancient greek historian, erodoted, maybe you know this story already.
it's the story of who invented games and why.
and i was willing to say that games, particularly the game games, were invented in the kingdom of lidia during a time of famine.
it turns out that the famine was so tough, that the king of lidia decided to do something unthinkable.
people were suffering, the population was in revolting, was extreme situation, needed extreme solution.
so, according to heroin, invented the game of dadi and emanating a good law for the whole kingdom.
one day, everybody would eat.
the next day, everybody's played.
and they immersed so deeply in the play games, since the moment that playing is so engaging, and they dive in a state of productivity, which ignored the fact that they had nothing to eat.
and so one day they were playing, and one day ate.
and according to heroin, so 18 years old, surviving the famine of eating a day and playing that next one day.
i think that's exactly the way we use games today.
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world.
we use games to move away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't meet us in real life, and we get what we need from games.
but we don't necessarily have to stop there.
this is very interesting: according to heroin, after 18 years old, the famine wasn't much better, so the king decided they would have played one last game in dice.
i'm going to collect the whole kingdom in half, played a game in dadi, and the winners of that game made a epic adventure.
they left the lidia and went looking for a new land where they live, leaving the right number of people to survive with available resources, with hope to bring their civilization somewhere else, where they might thrive.
it's a little weird idea, right?
but recently, studies of dna revealed that the etruschis that would then bring to the roman empire, share the same dna of the ancient inhabitants of lidia.
so recently, scientists suggested that the story narraties of heroin is a true story.
and geologists found evidence of global cooling that's almost 20 years old, and that might explain the famine.
so this amazing story could be true: they could actually save their culture playing, refugee in games for 18 years, and then being so inspired, and knowing how i'm coming to play at the game to save the whole civilization.
ok, we can do it too.
we play world of warcraft from 1994.
this was the first real-time strategy of world of warcraft's series. this was 16 years ago.
they played for 18 years, we played warcraft for 16 years.
i say, we're ready for our epic game.
they had half the population traveling to search for a new world.
this is where the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
we make half of us agree to spend an hour a day to play, until we solve real world problems.
" i guess what you're going to ask, " " how do we solve real world problems in a game? " " well, that's what i dedicated my work during the last years, at the institute for the future. "
in our palo alto offices, we have this stendardo that expresss our idea of how we ought to relate to the future.
we don't want to try to predict the future.
what we want to do is--the future.
we want to imagine the scene from the best results, and then we want to give people the possibility to turn them into real concrete.
we want to imagine epic victories to give people the tools to make them.
i'm going to show you briefly three games that i've done is that i'm an attempt to give people the tools to create epic victories in their future.
" this is" " world without oil. " " "
we did this game in 2007.
it's a online game where you're trying to survive a oil care.
the carence is not real, but we published enough online material to make it, and to make real life as if we were to dry it. so, when you get in the game, you record us in that area alive, and then after that, we give you real-time news, data that show exactly
the impact on transportation, if the schools are closed, and you have to think about how your life will live if that was real. then we ask you to have a blog about it, to publish videos, to publish pictures--
we started this game with 1, 700 players in 2007, and we looked at them since for the next three years, and what i can tell you is that it's an experience that transforms.
nobody wants to change the way they only live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a duty to do it.
" but if you dive them in a epic adventure and you say, " " we don't have oil anymore. "
this is an amazing story! an adventure you can participate!
" challenge yourself to see how you might survive. " " "
most of our players then kept the habits that learned in the game.
so for the next game game to save the world, we decided to mirare higher, to a bigger problem than oil care.
we made a game called superstruct, the institution for the future, and the premise was: a supercomputer calculated that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet.
" supercomputer was called" " global extinction system. " " of course. "
we asked people to reach online almost like a film of jerry bruckheimer.
you know, you know, jerry bruckheimer's movies, there's an astronaut, the scientist, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having five people in the dream team, everybody's part of the energy team, and
" 8, 000 people played for eight weeks, generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find online and google google" " superstruct. " " "
finally, the last game, will start marching three. this is a game that's made with the institute of the world bank.
if you drop the game, you'll be certificated by the institution of the world bank, as a social innovative, class of 2010.
working with university spreads for sub-saharan africa, we are invited to learn social innovation techniques.
there's a story in comics, and there's a level of ability because of local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and invent.
i want to invite all of you to share this game with young people, wherever in the developing areas, particularly in developing areas, which may benefit from join together to begin to imagine their social businesses to save the world.
it's time to finish.
i want to ask a question.
what do you think that's going to happen?
we have all these incredible players, we have these games that are the pilot projects of what we could do, but none of them still saved the real world.
well, i hope that you agree with me that abituali players are a human resource that we can use to work in the real world, that games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a joyful productivity, the capacity of tessere a robusta
and i really hope that we can get encounters to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you only tell me in making and participate in games like this.
when i look forward next decade, two things are certain: that we can make any future we can imagine, and that we can play any game we want.
so i say, let's start games that will change the world.
thank you.
" for some time, i've been interested in placebo effect, it may sound like a strange thing that a magician or accupi, unless you consider it from my point of view, " " something fake is believed to become something real, " " in other words, sugar pills have a
what's happening is due to a drug or something like that--
pain therapy, for example, if they believe they have a measure effect in the body called placebo effect.
something fake becomes something true for the perception of it.
and to understand that, i want to show you a magic trick, very simple.
and i'm going to show you how it works. this is a trick that's present in all books for children since the' 50s.
i learned it alone with magic cub in the 1970s.
i'm doing it for you and so i'll explain it.
and so i'll explain to you why i've explained it.
here's what happens.
knife, which you can examine; my hand, you can examine.
i simply'll knock the knife in my pugno, like this.
i'm going to put it on my hands.
to make sure that nothing goes down or save from my hands.
i'm going to shake my wrist like this.
so you can see something that's ever going to move on. as long as i'm here, it's going to be on or down from my hands.
and the purpose of that is simple.
i'm going to open my hand open, and if everything was okay, my pure animal magnetism will read the knife.
in fact, it remains to the place that i can shake it, and knife doesn't fall.
nothing goes on or down from my hands.
no tricks. you can examine anything.
ta-da!
this is a trick that often teach children.
which are interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about deception by studying this trickly and very simple and very simple.
many of you in this room will know this trick.
that's what's going on with knife in my hand.
i say i grab my wrist.
to make sure that nothing is going to save or down from my hands, this is a lie.
the reason i'm holding the wrist is because that's the secret of illusion.
the moment when my hand moves away from you, this finger here, my index, moved from where it was, in a position that tips out in the outside.
there's somebody who has no childhood here.
and so, from here, right.
and when i turn my finger, it moves.
we can talk about why it's deceptive, because you don't notice that there are only three toes down because the mind, and the way the information process, not count, one, two, three. it's getting it.
but that's not the point. right? and when i open my hand, obviously, it's not through the animal magnetism, but through deception, being my index here.
and when i close my finger, same thing, when i come back, this motion covers your finger back.
put your hand out. the knife comes away.
it's a trick you can do with your friends and neighbors. thank you.
now, what does this do with placebo effect?
i read a study, a year ago that swore my mind.
i'm not a doctor or a researcher, so it was an amazing thing.
it seems that if you give a placebo in the form of a white pill, made like a aspirin, just a circular pill, has a measure effect.
but if you change the shape and give placebo, under the form of a smaller pill, and of blue color and print a letter and more effective.
even though none of them have any drug--they're sugar pills.
but a white pill is not effective as a blue pill.
what? it really shocked me.
but anyway, that's not where it ends.
capsules are more effective than every form.
a colored capsule, which is yellow from one side and red on the other is better than a white capsule.
dosaggio has a role.
a pill twice a day is not so effective as three pills--now i don't remember statistics. sorry.
but the point is--
and these doses have a role.
and the shape also has a role.
and if you want the dark placebo, you have to use a needle.
right? a syringe with something--a couple of c. c. of something inert.
you inject it into a patient--
this is such a strong image in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
it's real, this graph--i'm going to show you another time when we're going to have slides.
the point is that the white pill is not effective as the blue that is not effective as the capsule, which is not how much a needle.
and none of them have a pharmaceutical quality.
it's just your belief that makes them real in your cover and strengthen the effect.
i wanted to see if i could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
and do something that's a fabulous trick and make it look real.
and we know from that study that when you want a effect you have to use the needle.
this is a seven-inch, very notes.
it's a bit sterile.
this is my meat. this is not special meat of damian.
this is my skin. this is not a special hollywood effect.
i'm going to break my skin and make this needle up to the opposite part.
if you try nausea--if you wake up easily--i did it for some friends in the hotel room, the other night, and for some people i didn't know, it's a woman's almost awkward.
so if you try to be nausea easily, i suggest that you don't look for the next 30--in fact, you know, i'm going to do the first part of it here.
you can see, you can look for another part.
here's what's happening here, right here, the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm just a little hole.
apologize. am i impressed?
and now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side, like this.
now, we are in the same position where we were with the knife of the knife.
but you can't count my fingers now, right?
so i'm going to show you. here's one, two three, four, five, yes, good.
i know what people think when they see that.
" they think, " " surely it's not going to be as stupid by buddhist to the skin just to become a few minutes. " " "
so let me leave you a map.
how does it look like that? pretty good.
" yes, i know the behind will say, " " ok, i haven't seen it well. " " "
people in the rooms are coming in.
let me show you next.
this is really my skin. it's not a special effect of hollywood.
this is my meat, and i can turn it around.
sorry, if you're feeling bad at the other end, you don't look at it.
" people at the bottom or looking for a few years the video will say, " " well, it's clear that makes some effect, but if it were true. . . "
" you see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it were true sanguine. " " "
well, now let me get some blood out for you.
here it is.
i normally leverage the needle.
i would clean my arm, and i'm going to show you there's no wound.
but i think in this context and the idea of taking something false and turn it into something true, and i'll leave it where it is, and i'll go from the stage.
we're going to see several times in the next few days i hope you don't see the hour. thank you very much.
so, in my life, i met a lot of fish.
i just loved two of them.
the first one is more than another of a passional history.
it was a wonderful blownfish, cute, one of the most sold to the menu.
what fish!
what's even better, it was from an increased farming standard of environmental sustainability.
so, you feel like consciousness to sell it.
i was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
one day, the head of the company called me and asked me to speak to a dedicated event to environmental sustainability.
" " " of course, " " i said. "
this was a company trying to solve what became a unimaginable problem for our chefs.
how do we continue to have fish in our menus?
over the last 50 years, we've fished in the seas in the same way that we've taken down the forest.
destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones that we like so much tuna, halibuts, salmon, swordfishs have fallen dramatically.
there's almost nothing left.
so we liked water or less water, fish farming, will become part of our future.
there's a lot of issues that are coming out.
the fish farming polluted, the less part of them are inefficient. take tuna for example.
a big problem is that there's a food conversion rate of 15 to one.
that means that it takes 15 wild pesce of wild fish to get an libbra of farming tuna.
it's not very sustainable.
and the taste is also not a big one.
so here's then, finally there was a company trying to do it in the right way.
i wanted to help them.
the day before the event i phoned at the head of the company's public relations.
let's call it don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " so to understand well, you're famous to make farming so far, open ocean, not polluted. " " "
" " " right, " " he said, " " we're so far away from the coast that our waste are diluted, don't focus. " " "
" and then he said, " " we're basically a world. " " "
" " " the conversion rate? 2.5 a" " said. "
" " " the best in the industry. " " "
2.5 to one, great.
" " " 2.5 a? what do you do to eat fish? " " "
" " " sustainable proteins, " " he said. "
" " " great, " " i said. i said the phone call. "
that night, i was in bed, i thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein?
so the next day, shortly before the event, i was called don.
" i said, " " don, do you make some examples of sustainable proteins? " " "
he said he didn't know, and he would have asked.
well, i talked to a little bit about the company and nobody will give me a precise answer.
as long as i finally talked to the chief biologist.
we call him him.
" " " don, " " i said, " " do you make some examples of sustainable proteins? " " "
" well, he mentioned some algae some fish feeds, and then he said, " " chicken pieces. " " "
" i said, " " chicken pieces? " " "
" he said, " " yes, pen, skin, bone, bone, dry and processed. " " "
" i said, " " what percentage of your mangoes is made of chicken? " " "
i thought, let's say, two percent.
" " " well, it's about 30 percent. " " he said. "
" i said, " " don, what is sustainable in giving fish of chicken to eat? " " "
" there was a long break at the phone and then said, " " there's just too many chickens in the world. " " "
i disagree with this fish.
no, it's not because they're one of those virtues of good health and traditional food.
well, actually, the truth is.
no, in fact, i disagree with this fish because, i'm going to watch that conversation, the fish knew chicken.
the second fish is a different story.
it's a romantic story that kind of story that the more you know the fish is the longer you love it.
i eat him for the first time in a restaurant in south of spain.
a friend of mine told me about this fish.
basically, he had met.
i got on the table had a brilliant black color, almost shiny.
the chef had too much cooked him.
basically twice as much as cooked.
incredibly, it was still delicious.
who is capable of making a fish so good after they have stracotto?
i don' t, but this guy is.
let's call it miguel.
it's actually called miguel.
no, she had no fish cooked, and it's not a chef.
for less, not in the sense that we normally mean.
it's a glass biologist that's a fish farming in the south-year-old angle of spain to the seals of the guadalquivir river.
up to the' 80s, the farming was run by the argents.
they raised bovini on what was essentially a balloon zone.
they took the earth by building an intricate series of canals so that water in the river.
well, they couldn't work the thing not from the economic perspective.
and, from the ecological perspective, it was a disaster.
he killed something like 90 percent of birds and, given the place, it's a lot of birds.
so, in 1982, a spagnola company with environmental consciousness buying soil.
what did they do?
they reverse the flow of water.
literally, they reverse the switch.
instead of conveying water from the ground using channels to flood it.
they flooded all the channels.
they created a fish farming from 27, 000 spigol, shrimp muggins, anguilles and in this process, miguel and this company in reversely reverse the ecological destruction.
farming is amazing.
i mean, you never saw something like this.
i looked at the horizon that seems to be distant a million miles, and all you see are flooding channels and this rich, dense land earth.
i've been there a little bit ago with miguel.
it's an amazing guy three quarti charles darwin is a fourth dunde crusade.
okay? we were fatying in the middle of this laguna and i anxiety, southavo, i had the mud to knees and miguel, calmissimo, he kept his biology class.
before i get a rare white nibbi.
and then i explained the mineral needle of the fitoplanklankm, and then he sees a kind of fish ragguted that reminds him of tanzania.
it turns out that miguel has spent most of his career at the national park in africa.
i asked him how it became such a fish expert.
" he said, " " fish? i don't know any fish. "
" i'm an expert in relationships. " " "
and immediately, they still toss up on rari birds, algae and strange water plants.
don't get me wrong, this was very fascinating, which is something like the biotic community revealed in the natural state.
it's interesting, but i was in love with it.
and my head continued to rethink that delicious layer that i had ate the previous night.
" so i interrupted it and said, " " miguel, what makes your fish so good? " " "
he pointed out the algae.
" " " i know, i know, the algae, the fitoplankcton, the relationships, yes, it's amazing. "
but what are your fish eating?
what is your food conversion conversion rate?
well, i'm telling you about how their fish is so rich that fish eat exactly what they would eat in a wild environment.
the biomass of plants, the fitoplankcton, zooplankton, is all that feeds fish.
the system is so healthy that self-renewables completely.
there's no eaten.
have you ever heard about an farming that doesn't feed the animals?
" later, i was driving around the ground with miguel and said, " " in a place like this, it seems so different from anywhere we've ever seen, how do you measure success? " " "
at that moment, it was like the director of a film had ordered the set shift.
we turned the corner, and we saw a scene between the most amazing and thousands of pink fenicoc, a real pink carpet that was lost in sight.
" " " that's success, " " he said. "
" " " look at their bread, they're pink. "
" they're packed. " " "
banchettando? i was completely confused.
" i said, " " miguel, but are they not banted with your fish? " " "
" " " yes, " " he said. "
" " " we lose about 20 percent of the fish and the fish eggs for birds. "
last year, there were 600, 000 birds more than 250 species.
" today it became the biggest and one of the most important private santuaries for birds across europe. " " "
" i said, " " miguel, but a bird's population is not the last thing you would like in a fish farming? " " "
it shocked the head, no.
" he said, " " we are alleviate in a unimaginative way. "
this is an ecological network.
the phoenix eat the shrimp.
shrimp eat the fitoplancton.
" so, more and more pink the pancia of the phoenix is the system. " " "
okay, so let's summarize it: an farming that doesn't feed its animals and measure its success based on health of his predators.
it's a fish farming, but it's also a birds's sanctuary.
ah, by the way, those phoenixs shouldn't even be there.
they make nest in a 150-miles town where the soil conditions are better for building nests.
every morning, they fly for 150 miles, and they come to the farming and every night, you do 150 miles back.
they do it because they're able to follow the white line of the highway in92.
seriously.
i imagine something like the march of penguins so i looked at miguel.
" and i said, " " miguel, they fly 150 miles down to the farming, and then they fly 150 miles back to return? "
" do they do it for their young people? " " "
i look at how if i just mentioned a song of whitney houston.
" he said, " " no, they do it because food is better. " " "
i didn't talk about the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious, and i usually don't like fish skin.
i don't like abbrustolity, i don't like crux.
it's that taste, like asphalt.
not the cook almost never.
and yet, when i took it to that south restaurant of spain, she didn't know about fish skin.
he had a sweet and clean taste was like giving a morso to the ocean.
i said this at miguel, and he announced.
" he said, " " skin is like a sponge. "
it's the last defense before anything you get in the fish body.
" it's evolved to hold impurity. " " "
" and then he said, " " but our water didn't learn. " " "
okay. a fish feeds his fish.
an farming that measures its success on the basis of the success of his predators.
and then i realize that when he says that the farming didn't take minimizing the thing because the water floats in that farming is from the river who is a river that leads to themselves with whether all the things that rivers tend to bring chemical contaminants of pesticides.
and when it flows down the system, it comes out of water and cleaner than it is.
the system is so healthy, which is purified water.
so, not just an farming that doesn't feed its animals not just a allecipher that measures its success based on the health of his predators, but an farming that's literally a purified water purification plant and not just for those fish, but also for you and for you.
because when water comes out, it goes into the atlantic.
it's a drop in the ocean, i know, but i know the welcome, and so you should also do this because this love story for how romantic and also education.
you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food is that you talk about fish that bovini.
what we now need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which food really has a good taste.
but for many people, this is a little too radical.
we're not realistic, we're passionate about food.
we're amant.
we love the markets of small farmers.
we love small family farms.
let's talk about local territory.
we eat biological.
" and when you say that these are the things that will ensure the future of the good food somewhere up and says, " " hey, you like the pink phenotypes, but how do you think you can feed the whole world? "
" how do you think you can feed the world? " " "
can i be honest?
it's a question i don't like it.
no, not because we produce more than enough calories that we can feed the world.
a billion people have hunger today.
one billion--more than any of us have ever been--because of huge inequality in the distribution not for the complex amount.
you see, i don't like that question because it determines the logic of our food system over the last 50 years.
" give cereals to the pesticide herbivores to monoculture, chemicals to chicken soils, and in all this time, the agricultural industry simply asked, " " if we can feed more people more cheaper, what's wrong with what we do? " " "
this was the motivation.
it was the rightification.
it was the business plan of american agriculture.
we should be calling it for what it is, a industry in liquidation a industry that's quickly erodenng the ecological capital that makes the same production as possible.
this is not a industry, and it's not agriculture.
our sandwich today is threatened now not because of the supplyry supply, but the resources in diminished, not for the last mechanical invention, but for the fertile land, not for the pumps, but for the fresh water, not for motion motions, but for forests and not for the pescherec
do you want to feed the world?
so let's start asking ourselves: how do we feed ourselves?
or how can we create the conditions that allow every local community to feed itself?
to do that, we don't look at the agricultural industry model of the future.
it's an old and tired model.
it's all about capital, chemistry and machines, and it never really produced anything good to eat.
instead, let's look at the ecological model.
that's what it's about two billion years of working experience.
so let's look at migrations, like miguel and farms and farms that are not closed worlds in self-farm that reconstructing instead of consuming farms that grow aestheticly instead that only intensivally allevatoris that are not just producers but experts in relationships, because they' re
if i really have to be honest, they are better chefs than i could ever be.
you know, it's okay, because if that's the future of good food, it's delicious.
thank you.
i grew up with a diet that's called science fiction.
at high school i would take a schoolbus, an hour back and forth every day.
and i was always immersed in a book, a science fiction book, who took my mind into other worlds, and satisfied, in fiction, that insatiable sense of curiosity i had.
and that curiosity was also manifest in fact that every time i wasn't in school, i was out in the woods, for scaling samples, frogs, snakes, insects and stagnant water, took them home, watching them at the microscope.
i was a real geek of science.
but it was always about trying to understand the world, understanding the limits of possible.
and my love for science fiction actually seemed to answer the world around me, because what was happening in the late' 60s--we were going to explore the depths of the oceans, jacques cousteau came into our salotti with his wonderful documentaries showing us animals and places
so, everything looked at me with my passion for science fiction.
and i was an artist.
i knew drawing. i knew painting.
and since there were no video games or this film saturation generated to the computer, nor all of these pictures in the landscape of the media, i had to create these pictures in my head.
as a child, when we read a book, we all had to, through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our heads.
and so, my answer was painting, drawing alien creatures, alien worlds, robot, spatial ships, all this stuff.
at math lessons i had always been able to doodling behind the textbook.
that's because creativity had to find a way out there.
and something interesting happened: the jacques cousteau programs were involved much for the fact that there was a alien world right here on earth.
maybe i never go to a alien world on a space ships.
it looked very unlikely.
but that was a world where i could really go, right here on earth, richer and exotic than i could ever imagine reading these books.
so, i decided i'd become a sommozzator at age 15.
and the only problem was that i lived in a small country in canada, 600 miles from the nearby ocean.
but i wasn't left to encourage.
i took my father as long as he found a buffalo dive school, new york city, just spent the border from where we lived.
and so i managed to take the certificate in a 19th century swimming in the winter in buffalo, new york.
and i wouldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to california.
since then, over the last 40 years, i spent about 3, 000 hours underwater, and 500 of these hours in submersibles.
and i learned that the depths of the ocean, even the deep oceans, are surprising rich life that really goes beyond our imagination.
nature's imagination is without borders than our limited human imagination.
again, i'm intimate from what i see when i do dive.
and my story of love with the ocean continues, stronger than ever before.
but when i picked a career, as an adult, i chose to make films.
it seemed to be the best way to reconcile this one to stop telling stories with the texture of creating images.
and as a kid, i was constantly trained and so forth.
so movies was the only way to put images together and stories.
everything came back.
" and of course the stories i chose to tell were science fiction stories: " " termintator, " " " " aliens" " and" " the abyss. " " "
" and with" " the abyss" " i joined my love for depths and immersions with the realization of a movie. "
so, i was the two passions.
" from" " the abyss" " came out of something interesting that was solved a specific narrative in that film, which is to create that kind of liquid water creature--we adopted the animation generated with the computer. "
and so it was born the first soft surface and computer-animate character that had ever seen in a film.
and even though the film hasn't done a lot of money, i would say that barely got rid of it, i was witnessed something extraordinary, all the public was hypnotized by this apparent magic.
you know, it's arthur clarke's law that every advanced enough technology is indistinguishable by magic.
they were seeing something magical.
and that was very excited to me.
" and i thought, " " great, this is something that has to be adopted in the art cinematografica. " " "
" so with" " terminator 2" " , my next film, we went far beyond. "
working with industrial light and magic, we created the liquid metal metal guy in that movie. success was dependent on how it would work that effect.
and it worked. and we've created a magic again.
and we got the same outcome with a public.
but we earn a little bit more with that movie.
so by tracking a line between these two points of experience, i came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world, was a whole new world of creativity for cinema artists.
so, i took a company with stan winston, my dear friend stan winston, who was the main tricky and creature designers at that time, and we called digital domain.
and the principle of society was leaving the past, the analogous processes of optical printers and so forth, and going directly to digital production.
and so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
but we went back to half the 1990s in the design part of creatures and characters, which is what we had founded society.
" so, i wrote this text called" " avatar" " with the intention of pushing the most visual effects, generated the computer, with emotional and realistic human characters generated to the computer, and all the main characters generated to the computer and the entire world generated to the computer. "
and the whole thing was sent to the mittente.
the kids in society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a while.
so, i walked it up and made this film of a big ship hungry.
" i put it there as a" " romeo and juliet on a ship. " " "
it would be a story of epic love, passional film.
" secretly, what i wanted to do was immersed me to see the titanic' s" " titanic. " " "
that's why i did that film.
and it's the truth. the study didn't know.
" but i convinced them. i said, " " we dive to the relitto. we take it back from live. "
we're going to use it for the beginning of the movie.
" it's going to be very important. it's going to be a fantastic marketing gancio. " " "
and i convinced them to fund a expedition.
it sounds crazy. but this brings us back to the imagination that creates reality.
because we really created a reality and six months later, i found myself on a two-mile submersibles and depth of depths in north atlantic, looking at the real titanic from a oblo, not in a movie, not in high definition, but really.
i was amazed.
and it took a lot of preparation, we had to build chinese and lights and lots of other things.
but i was sent by those deep dives, it was like a space mission.
where everything was highly technical, and they require huge planning.
you put yourself in this capsule, you go down to this dark environment where there are no hopes of being saved, where you can't go back to yourself.
" and i thought, " " great. it's like living in a science fiction movie. "
" it's really cool. " " "
and so, i've been affecting from the exploration of deep ocean exploration.
of course, curiosity, scientific component.
it was everything. it was adventure.
it was curiosity. it was imagination.
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't offer me.
of course, i could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. but i couldn't imagine what i saw outside the oblo.
in our front expeditions, i saw creatures with hydrothermal openings, and sometimes, things that i'd never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, that actually wasn't even described by science at the time when we saw them and imagined them.
so i was all taken from this and i had to do more.
so i took a curious decision.
" after the success of" " titanic, " " i said, " " okay, i put my daily work from hollywood director work, and i do the full-time explorer for a while. " " "
so, we started planning these expeditions.
we found ourselves to go to the bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles.
we went back to the titanic relitt.
we took small robots that we had created with fiber optics.
and the idea was to go inside and make a overlook inside the ship, which had never been done.
no one had ever looked inside the relitto. they didn't have the means to do it, so we created the technology to do it.
so here i am on the bridge of the titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the axis that seemed like this, where i knew they had played the violinists.
and i'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the hall hall hall hall hall.
when i say that, i'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
it seemed to me that i was physically present within the titanic relitt.
and it was the most surreal experience that i've ever experienced, because before i went to the corner, i knew what would be behind, before the luxury of the vehicle would reveal it, because i had set for months around the movie.
and set was based on an exact replication of the ship model.
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
and it really made me realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these avatar robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle, in this other form of existence.
it was very deep.
and it could be a little taste of what might happen in some decades when we start to have cyborgs for exploration or other reasons in some kind of post-human future that i can imagine, from science fiction to science fiction which are.
so, we did these expeditions, and really started to appreciate what's underneath it, such as the openness of the depths of the ocean where these animals are.
basically, it's alien right here on earth.
they live in a chemosintes environment.
they don't survive in a system based on sunlight as we do.
so, you see animals living next to water current to 500 degrees centigrade.
it seems even impossible to exist.
at the same time, i was very interested in the space science, again, and the influence of science fiction, as a kid.
and i ended up in the space environment, really engaging with nasa, sitting in the consultive council of nasa, to plan space missions, go to russia, go to the biomedical protocol of pre-cosmonauta, and all of these things, to fly to international space station with our 3d
it was fascinating.
but what i've done to do was take the space scientists with us in the abortion.
and take them down because they could have access to astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people care about these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them to see, take samples, test instruments and so on.
so, we were turning some documentaries, but we actually did science, spatial science.
i had closed the ring between the science fiction, as a kid, to make those things really.
and you know, during this journey of discovery, i learned a lot.
i learned a lot about science. but i also learned a lot about leadership.
everybody think that a director should be a leader, the captain of the ship, or something like that.
i didn't know anything leadership before i do all those expeditions.
" because at some point i had to say, " " what am i doing here? "
" why am i doing that? what do i do? " " "
it doesn't make all of these spectacular things.
barely, we're in equal. there's no fame.
" people almost think i've gone from" " titanic" " and" " avatar" " is that i'm walking chickens sitting on some beach. "
i made all these films, all these documentaries for such limited audience.
no fame, no gloria, no money. what am i doing?
i'm doing it for the task in itself, the challenge--and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists, for the brilliant of discovery, and for the strange bond that will be inserted when a small group of people form a profoundly compressed team.
because we did everything with 10 to 12 people, working together for years.
sometimes in the sea for two-three months of line.
and in that connection, you realize that the important thing is respect to them is that they have for you, when you finished a task you can't explain to anybody else.
" when you go back to the ground and you know, " " we had to do this, and fiber optics, and that is, all technology, and the difficulty, the aspects of human perfoman when you work in the sea--you can't explain it. that's the thing that
create a connection, create a link of respect.
" when i came back to do my next film, i mean, " " avatar" " i tried to apply the same principle of leadership which is that they can respect the team and in exchange their respect. "
it's really changed the dynamic.
" and so here i am once with a small group, in territory that we could do" " avatar" " with new technologies that didn't exist before. "
terribly exciting.
tremendously challenging.
and we've become a family, in the four and a half years.
and it completely changed my way to make movies.
people commented by saying that i took organisms from the ocean and put them on the pandora planet.
for me, it was the essence of business, the process itself, that had changed.
so what can we do next?
what are the lessons we've learned?
i think the first one is curiosity.
it's the most powerful thing we own.
imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
and the respect of the group is more important than all the allori in the world.
" young filmmakers come to me and say, " " give me some advice to do this. " " "
" and i say, " " don't get limits. "
other people will do it for you, don't do it alone, don't bet against yourself.
" and you get risks. " " "
" nasa always says this sentence: " " the mistake isn't contemplating. " " "
but the mistake needs to be an option in art and exploration, because it's like making a jump in the vacuum.
and no important attempt that innovation was made without risk.
you have to be willing to run these risks.
this is the thought i want to leave you with, which is that in anything you do, mistake is an option, but fear doesn' t. thank you.
if today, i wanted to make a single idea today, it would be that the set of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts, and instead of thinking about the troppa information, i'd like to think about how to use information to make new relationships so that we can see new
here you can see some organized mortality of age mortality.
this device that i use is a little experiment.
it's called pivot, and with pivot, i can choose to filter one cause of death, say accidents.
and immediately we see new relationships emerges.
the reason is that here in central part, people are active; and here are more fragile.
we can step back and reorganize the data because of death, we see that circulated and cancer and cancer are the biggest insight, but not for everyone.
if we move forward and filters for age, let's say below 40, we see that accidents are the cause of death that we care about most.
he's seen closer, especially for men.
so you've got to understand that visualizing information and data like this is a little bit like swimming in a sea of graphic information.
and if we can do it with raw data, why don't we do it with content?
for example here, we have the cover of every sports illustrated ever printed.
everything. everything in the net.
you can go back to your rooms and try you.
with pivot, you can see a decade.
or a specific year.
you can isolate a particular number.
so let's take athletes that look like this number, their sports.
i'm a fan of lance armstrong, so i'm clicking here and i see all the numbers where lance armstrong looks.
" now, if i want to look at it, i might think, " " why don't you look at the whole thing? " " "
i'm going to step back, and i'm calling the visual.
and now i see greg lemond.
you've got to understand that when you navigate information more closely or further from distant and further backwards, it's not just a research, it's not the usual browser.
but do something slightly different.
it's a middle way that according to us will change how we can use information.
we're still going to hang this idea that it may seem a little crazy.
we took every single page of wikipedia and we reduced it to a brief summed up which is in a little synonymous and an icon that indicates the dark area.
i'll just show you the first 500 of the most visited on wikipedia.
even in this limited screen, we can do a lot.
you'd immediately understand what areas issues are the most visited on wikipedia.
at this point, they select government entities.
this option, we see that the categories of wikipedia more often associated with this voice are the characters of time magazine.
this is significant because it does emerge something that in wikipedia's pages wasn't there.
and you can only see it by step back to see the together.
" if i take one of these summaries, i can then zoom in on the" " characters of the year" " in time magazine. "
and they all see them.
at this point, i see that most of them comes from government entities some of the world of science, a less than the business world.
here's my boss.
one is from music.
and, pretty interestingly, bono also won a ted prize.
so let's see all the winners of the ted prize.
for the first time, we're really navigating network as if it was a network, not from page page, but at a higher abstract level.
i want to show you another thing that might surprise you.
this is the new york times website.
pivot, this app--not called the browser, because it's not browser, but it's still going to see web pages--we add this technology for zoom to every page, like this.
i can step back and immediately go back to a specific section. this is important because the only viewing web pages so it makes me see my whole navigation in the internet at the same way.
i can zoom in what i did in particular moments.
in fact, you see the state of the demo that i just presented.
i can kind of figure out other things that i saw in day.
if i want to step back and see everything i can do to make my historian or the historian of my research.
here i was looking for a nepotistic way, looking for the bing engine here for live labs pivot.
and from here i can zoom in on my web page is simply re-re-up here.
a metaphor reuse many times, and in any case, the result is greater than the sum of the parts, of starting data.
today, in the world today, data is seen as sort of a curse.
it's about overheading information.
it's about drowning in the data.
what if we put everything down, if we put the web undersea, instead of going from one thing to the other, we used to move from many things to many others and then can we see those structures that would otherwise be hidden?
and then instead of feeling trapped in the data, we could really extract information.
instead of dealing with just information, we can get out of knowledge.
and from knowledge, maybe you get wisdom.
and thank you very much.
these days all talk about happiness.
" i asked count the number of books contain the word" " happiness" " in title and published in the last five years, they stopped counting after they reached 40, and there were many more. "
there's a huge wave of interest in happiness, between researchers.
there's a lot of coachings on happiness.
everybody wants to make people happier.
but despite all this flow of work, there's a series of cognitive traps that makes it impossible to make meaningful ideas related to happiness.
" my talk today's talk is going to restore these cognitive traps. " " "
and it's about both profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about scholars that study happiness, because it turns out we are confused like all the others.
the first of these traps is reluctant to admit complexity.
it turns out that the happiness word is no longer a useful word than we apply to too many fields.
" i think you can force it to a particular meaning, but in the top line, we're going to have to draw about this accret, and we're going to have to adopt the most complicated vision of what the well-being is. " " "
the second traps and the confusion between experience and memory: it's basically to choose between being happy in life and be happy in their life or happy about their lives.
and these are two extremely different concepts, both of the concept of happiness.
and the third is the illusion of focalization that is unfortunate that we can't think of any circumstances that affect the well-being without distorting the importance.
i mean, this is a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
i'd like to start with an example of someone who, after a session of questions and answers, after a lesson, i tell a story.
[unclear] ] he said that as he listened to a absolutely wonderful music symphony right at the end of recording, ♪ you hear a terrible stridulo sound.
and then he added, very emotionally, that he had ruined the entire experience.
but it wasn't true.
what had been ruined was the experience memory.
he lived the experience.
and he heard for 20 minutes of wonderful music.
but that didn't realize why he was with a certain memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all he left him.
" what this episode tells us, at the bottom, is that we might think about ourselves and other people in terms of" " if. " " "
there's one self that lives of the experiences, living in the present and knowing the present, and it's capable of re-live the past, but it's basically the present.
" it's the" " if living the experiences" " and where the doctor gets closer to--you know when the doctor asks, " " do you hurt you now, when he touches here? " " "
" and then there's the" " if you remember, " " is it" " if you remember the dottor, and it's about the story of our life, and it's the" " if" " where the doctor gets closer to, " " how are you heard in the last time
" or" " how did your journey in albania? " " or something like that. "
those are two different entities, the self that lives an experience is what if remember, it's confusing between the two and part of the confusion on the notion of happiness.
the self that reminds, it's a storyteller.
and this process starts with a fundamental response of our memories--starts immediately.
we don't tell stories only when we decide to tell them.
our memory tells us stories, which is, what remains our experiences is a story.
let me start with an example.
this is an old study.
which brings the experiences of two patients during painful process.
i won't go into detail. it's not even painful today, but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s.
he asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
and here's the results for two patients.
those are their results.
" if you ask yourself, " " who are two suffering more? " " "
it's a very simple question.
clearly, the patient b suffered more.
his tougher tougher harder and for every minute of pain suffering from the patient to the patient b has suffered at least as much as a or more.
" but now there's another question: " " how much patients think they've suffered? " " "
and here's the surprise: that's the patient who had a memory memory memory memory for much worse than the patient b.
the stories of colonscopies were different, that a particularly particularly delicate of the procedure is the way it ended--none of these stories is particularly positive--but one of the two is different--one of them is particularly worse than the other.
and the worst is where pain was largely in the final moment.
it's a negative story.
how do i know?
" why do we asked those people after colonscopia, and also at the distance of time, " " how negative was the experience, all considered? " " "
it's very much worse than b, in reminds.
so it's a direct conflict between the self that lives the experiences and the self that reminds them.
from the perspective of the self that lives experience, it's clear that b has suffered most.
so, what you could do for the patient a, and we've done clinical trials, and it's actually done, and it's working, you could extend the patient's colonscopy to keep the tube without getting it too much.
this will cause some pain in the patient, but just a little bit, it's much less than before.
and by doing this for a couple of minutes, the self who lives the experience of the patient is worse, and the self that reminds the patient's experience is much better, because now the patient has a better memory of his experience.
how do you define a story?
and that's true both stories that are coming from memories that for the stories that we invent a story, are changes the significant moments and the end moments.
the finalis are very, very important, and in this case, the final final dominate.
so, the self that lives experiences his life in a way that keeps life.
it's times when it's living experiences that are suspicious and questions: what happens to these moments?
and the answer is simple.
i've even lost forever to say that most moments of our lives--as i calculated them--i mean the psychologist is telling about three seconds, which means that in a life, we count about 600 million in a month if they count about 600, 000, most of which don' t
most of them are completely ignored by the self that remembers.
and yet, you have the feeling that they should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our lives.
these are the limited resources we're spending as we are in this world.
and as you spend it, it would seem relevant, but it's not the story that the self that reminds you of for us.
so we have a self that reminds and a self that lives with experiences that are quite different.
the biggest difference between the two is how to treat time.
from the perspective of the self that lives experiences, if you go to holiday, and the second week is as much as much as the first one, then the vacation of two weeks is twice better than the holiday of a week.
but that's not absolutely the way it works the self that reminds.
for the self that reminds, a two-week vacation is better than a week of vacation because there's no new memories in addition.
you didn't change the story.
and in this way, time is critical variable that distinguishes the self that reminds from the self that lives experiences.
time has a limited impact on this story.
well, the self that remembers the experiences more than remembering and telling stories.
" it's actually the self that takes decisions because, if you look at a patient that's had, for example, two colonscopies with two different doctors and is decide what the two choices are, what he scgelies is what he has the worst memory, and that will be the doctor
the self that lives experiences doesn't have voice in these choices.
in fact, we don't choose between experiences, but in the memories of those experiences.
and even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as an experience.
we think of our future as memorie anticipate.
basically, you can consider this situation, like a tyranny of the self that reminds, and you can think of the self that reminds the self that lives experiences through experiences of which, the self that lives experiences, doesn't need.
i've got the feeling that when we go to holiday often give the case that, it's going to go to vacation to the service of our self that reminds.
and this is a little bit hard to justify.
which is, how consume our memories?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the predominately of the self that reminds.
when i think about that, i think a vacation in antarctica a few years ago, which is one of the best vacations of my life, and i think i'm relatively often thinking about other vacation.
and i've probably spent thinking about the memories of that three-week journey, forget, 25 minutes in the last four years.
if i opened the cartella with the 600 photographs of the journey, i'd spent another time now is three weeks of journey that translate into a time and half. it seems to be a discrepancy.
well, i could be a little extreme, in my scarcerated rehearsal consumption, but even though you're doing more than that, a genuine question asks.
why are we going to give weight to memory than the weight that we make experiences?
now i want you to think about a thought experiment.
imagine that during the next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all photographs will be destroyed, and that you take a medicine for amnesia so that you don't remember anything.
would you choose the same vacation? and if you could choose different vacation, you create a conflict between the two if and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and actually isn't so obvious because, if you think about time, then you'll have an answer.
and if you think of it in terms of memories, you could get another answer.
because we choose the vacation that we do, it's a problem that puts us in front of choices between the two.
the two if they carry two notions of happiness.
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for each self.
so you can ask: how happy is it that makes experience?
and then you can ask: how happy are the moments in the lives of the self that lives experiences?
and it's about--happiness for moments it's a complicated process.
what are the emotions that we can measure?
and by the way, we are now able to do a pretty good idea of happiness of the self that lives experiences over time.
if you ask the happiness of the self you remember, it's a completely different thing.
it's not as happy as a living person.
it's about how satisfaction or complained is the person when he thinks his life.
it's a very different idea.
" anyone who can't distinguish these two notions, it's not going to do anything that" " create confusions" " in the studies of happiness, and i belong to a group of well-being students, who have disappeared studies on happiness for a long period of time in this
the difference between the happiness of the self that lives experiences and the satisfaction of the self that reminds was recognizing over the last few years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separates, the chicken institute has a world-level survey where more than half a million people
and there were other studies in this direction.
so in the last few years, we began to learn about the happiness of two.
and the biggest lesson we've learned, is that they're very different.
you might know how much a person is satisfied with your life, and yet this doesn't tell you a lot about how happy they're living their lives and vice versa.
to give you an idea of correlation, correlation is about 0.5.
" which means that if you met someone, and they said, " " oh, her father is high 1.80 m" " how much would you know about her height? "
well, you know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
you'd always have some uncertainty.
if i tell you that somebody thinks that his life is at the stage eight at a scale from one to 10, you'll be very uncertain about how happy they are with their self that lives.
so the correlation is low.
we have a certain knowledge of what makes your happy satisfaction.
we know that money is very important, goals are very important.
we know that being happy means to be satisfied with the people that we like, spend time with the people that we like.
there are other pleasures, but these are the main ones.
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two, you end up doing things very different.
the conclusion of what i said so far is that we shouldn't think of happiness as a substitute of well-being.
it's about two completely different ideas.
more, very quickly, another reason why we can't think linearly to happiness is that we don't pay attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
so, if you ask the simple question about how happy people are in california, you can't get the right answer.
when you ask this question, think you should be happier in california, which in ohio.
what's happening is that when you think about life in california, you're thinking about the contrast between california and other places, and for example that comparison is climate.
well, it turns out that climate is not as important for the self that lives experiences and not very important for the self that reflects that it's what it's going to decide how happy people are.
but because the self that reflects is in charge, you might end up--some people might, ultimately, move in california.
and it's interesting to realize what's going to happen to the people who transfer in california in hope to be happier.
well, the self that lives experiences is not going to be happier.
we know.
but something will happen. they'll think they're happier, because when they think about it, they'll remember how awful it was time in ohio.
and they'll think they've got the right decision.
it's very difficult to think of the well-being, and i think i've given you the idea of how hard it is.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. i have a question for her.
thank you very much.
when we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned that an interesting outcome that's made from the gallup survey.
is it something that thinks we can share before we have a few minutes?
daniel kahneman: of course.
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup poll is a number, that we didn't expect to find.
we found that, with the happiness of the self that lives experiences.
when we looked at how the feelings were born with income, we found that, below a 60, 000-dollar income per year, for americans, on a study done on a very large sample of about 600, 000 americans, it's a representative sample, below a 600, 000 dollars a year-
ca: 60, 000, 000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become progressively more unhappy as they become poorer, above that, we find a flat line.
i mean, i saw some lines like this.
of course, what's happening is that money doesn't buy happiness of experience, but lack of money certainly acquired misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
in terms of the other if, the self that reminds, is another story.
more money guadgani, the more happy you are.
this talk doesn't react to emotions.
ca: ma danny, all american efforts are about life, freedom, pursuit of happiness.
if people were seriously taking this discovery, they basically turn everything we believed in, for example, the policy on tax and so forth.
is there a chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and carry a public policy based on it?
dk: you know i think the role of happiness in public policy.
the consideration of consideration is going to be slow in the united states, but in the u. k. , it's becoming real, and in other countries.
people are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think public policy.
it's going to take a little bit and people start to start talking about whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the evaluation of life that we need to start this debate soon.
how to embrace happiness, taking different directions depending on how you think, and depending on whether you remember or whether it does experiences.
all of this will affect policy, i think, in the years that will come.
in the united states, they're making effort to measure the experience of happiness in population.
and that, i think, is going to be part of the next decade, perhaps two, of the national statistics.
ca: well, it seems to me that this subject will be, or at least it should be, the most interesting policy argument to follow over the next few years.
thank you very much for invent behavioral economics.
thank you very much danny kahneman.
today i'm going to talk about energy and climate.
it may seem strange, because in my work at the foundation, i'm invent with vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the two billion poorest people to live better lives.
but climate is energy, in fact, are extremely important for people, in fact, are more important for them than anyone else in the world.
a worst climate means for many years, loss of collected.
it will fall too much rain or too little.
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
which leads to hunger. uncertainty. conflicts.
so, climate change, they're going to be terrible.
the cost of energy is, for them, important.
in fact, if you were to lower the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose long energy.
the price of energy went down over time.
it's a progress civilization because of energy field.
coal revolution powered that industrial.
and even in the 20th century, we witnessed a quick decline in electricity price, which explains why we have refrigerators, shared, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
so, in the rich world, we are about the electricity in an excellent situation.
but as the price goes down, for example, we have to respect a new constraints, the constraints of co2 emissions.
the co2 is heating the planet, and his equation is very simple.
co2 causes a temperature increase, which is very negative effects.
the climate effects is, perhaps even worse, indirect effects, in the sense that natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and then collapse.
the evaluation of how much temperature is because of a co2 increase, and as each of the two worse things the other, it's uncertain, but not much.
and there's certainly definitely uncertainty about how negative these are, but of course it's going to be extremely negative.
on this, i often asked the best scientists: do we really have to reduce emissions almost zero to zero?
can't we just get back to half or a quarter?
and the answer is, as long as we don't go down to zero, the temperature will continue to get up.
it's a big challenge, so.
" it's not like to say, " " let's move a three-and-a-half-three trucks. " " "
" it's not about" " lower it. " " "
it's about to get to zero.
now, we emit a lot of co2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
about 20 tons for every american.
for the people in the poor countries, it's less than a ton per capita.
the world average is about five tons per capita.
and somehow, we need to make progress that bring that amount to zero.
emissions are constantly increased.
only some economic changes have changed this trend, so we have to move from increase rapidly to diminished to zero.
this equation has four factors.
it's a series of multiplied.
we have the amount on the left, the co2, which has to be held, and the factors on the right are the population, the services that each person uses, the average energy demand for each service and the co2 emitted unit of energy.
let's look at each fact and see how we can get it.
probably, one of these numbers has to lower up almost to zero.
it's high school algebra.
let's see a little bit.
the first factor is population.
the world today is 6.8 billion people.
we rushed to nine billion.
if we do a good job with new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health, we can decrease maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we record about 30 percent increase.
the second factor is the services we use.
the understanding everything, the food that we eat, the clothing, the tv, the heating.
they're desirable things, and they're liberating poverty means providing these services for almost everybody in the world.
and it's a positive thing that this number is forgotten.
in the rich world, in the biggest billion, we may probably save and use less, but on average, every year, this number will go up.
and so, vastly, the amount of pro capite erogat services will be more che doppia.
this is a very simple example of service.
you have the lighting in your house, to make tasks, but these guys don' t, so they go out and read their homework under the street street.
how much efficiency--and, the energy unit of erogated service--this is finally good news.
this is not increasing.
thanks to many inventions, new ways of enlightenment, automobiles that are differently, built construction differently, for many services, you can decrease the consumed energy.
in some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
there are other services, like fertilizer, or air transportation, where the margins of improvement are very, very inferior.
so, of course, in the best of the cases, the energy consuming will get back from three to maybe six times.
but these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 to, in the best of the cases, perhaps 13 billion tons.
it's not enough.
let's look at the fourth factor, the key factor, the amount of emitted co2 per unit of energy.
the question is, can we get it to zero?
if you burn coal, no.
if you burn natural gas, no.
almost all the ways to produce electricity today, except renewables and nuclear, emit co2.
so what we're going to do on global scale is to create a new system.
" and we need" " miracles" " energy. "
" the word" " miracle, " " i don't mean anything impossible. "
the microprocessor is a miracle. personal computer is a miracle.
the internet, and his services, are a miracle.
people here have been faced with creation of many miracles.
we don't usually have a dead, a date by which to deliver the miracle.
normally, it's at the window and something happens, something else.
in this case, instead, we have to drive all of the speed, and make a miracle in a very narrow time.
i thought, how do you illustrate this concept?
is there any natural example, some demonstration that captures people's imagination?
i rethink a year ago, when i took mosquitos, and people find it funny.
they made them part of the fact that, in the world, there are people who consume mosquitos.
this is my idea for energy.
i decided that to fly fireflies would have been this year this year.
here are fireflies.
they say they don't punish, they may not even get out of the jar.
now, we can invent tricks like this, but they're not going to help.
we need solutions, one or many of them who are, who work on big scale and very reliable, and although they're exploring in many directions, i think only five will be important.
i started the tides, geothermal, nuclear fusion, biofuels.
they may also give some contribution, and if they can do more than i look, much better, but i'm interested in pointing that we're going to have to work on each one of these five, and not to give up any, as arduo, because all of the tough challenges are
let's look at the fossil fuel combustion, coal or natural gas that is.
here our task looks simple, but it's not, and it's catching co2, after combustion, coming out of the head, pressurize it, liquefarla, put it somewhere, and hope that will remain.
today there are experimental technologies that capture 60 to 80 percent of co2, but to achieve 100 percent will be very complicated and it's going to be hard to agree on where all this co2 is.
the spinal question is still the long term.
who's going to fix?
who asks something that's literally billions of times more volumiive than any other kind of imaginable rejection, like nuclear or whatever?
it's a huge volume.
so it's a hard problem.
another source would be nuclear.
but nuclear offers three big problems.
the cost, especially in very regular countries, is high.
the question of security, the feeling of secure that nothing can go wrong, despite the plant as well as the human operator, is that the fuel is not used in beautiful purpose.
and then how do we deal with this?
despite the amount of reduced, the concerns are many.
people need to be reassurance.
so, three very difficult problems, so that you could solve, and what you should work on.
the last three of the five sources, i heard her.
these are the ones that people often define renewables.
and actually, despite the great advantage of not requires fuel, they're reading some disadvantage.
the first is that the energy density produced with these technologies is so much less than a power plant.
" it's called" " collecting energy, " " and so many square kilometers, of areas of thousands of times larger than a normal power plant. "
also, these sources are intermittent.
the sun won't shine all day, nor every day, and the wind is always blown away.
so if you're dependent on these sources, you've got to find a way of electrical power even when the source does not produce.
big challenges were brought us on the front of the cost.
it's on distribution.
for example, let's say that this energy source is about abroad.
so not only do we need technology, but you also have to make the risk of the risk of the abroad.
and finally, the problem of accumulation.
to estimate the dimensions of the problem, i looked at all the types of realities today, for cars, computers, cell phones, all kinds of electrical energy use in the world, and i found that all batteries now can store less than 10 minutes than that energy.
so we really need a big step forward, a better improvement of 100 times compared to the approach now.
which is not impossible, but of course it's not very simple.
this problem is already when the intermittent sources produce more than, say, 20 or 30 percent of the energy consumed.
" if you rely on those sources for 100 percent, you need a miracle battery. " " "
but how are we going to fall on this road? what's the right approach?
is it a manhattan project? what might solve the problem?
many companies, hundreds of companies, have to get to work.
we need at least 100 people in each one of these five sectors.
many of them, look at them, would define them crazy. which is good.
and i think here in the ted group, a lot of people are already working in these fields.
bill gross has different companies, including an exlar called great technology in the thermal solar.
wined khosla is investigating dozen companies that are doing great things and have interesting potential, and i'm giving my support to that.
nathan myhrvold and i are funded a company that will surprise you, following the road of nuclear.
there have been some innovations in the branch, the nuclear modular, the liquid nuclear.
but for a long time, the industry is stop, that there are some good ideas around it isn't so surprising.
the idea of landpower is that instead of burning only part of uranium, u235, one percent of the uranium available, we decided to burn the u238, 99 percent is a crazy idea, in a certain sense.
and for the truth, it's been talking for a long time, but it's never been adequately tried whether it would work or not, just because of the advent of modern supercomputers today you can make a simulation and see that you, with the right materials, it seems to
and because it burned 99 percent of uranium, the structure of the cost is dramatically dramatically.
they burn the waste, and they use how fuels of the reactors today, that become, from the problem they were, a resource to exploit.
it consumes uranium as combustion is a kind of candle.
it's like a wooden circle. it's often called the wave wave reactor.
from the fuel point of fuel is solved.
here's a picture of a place in kentucky.
this is the shoe, the 99 percent of the uranio, which has been taken the part now used as fuel, and therefore it's called the impoverished uranium.
" these" " shoe" " would give energy to the united states for centuries. "
and by filtering seawater, with a economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of this planet's life.
so there's a lot of challenges, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward.
how should we measure our progress?
what should the pagelle contain?
we communicate the goal, and then we evaluate intermedi steps.
you've heard a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to do.
20 percent will be produced by poor countries, and from a little bit of agriculture.
at that point, we're hoping, we'll solve deforestation and concrete production.
to get to 80 percent, so, the developed nations, including nations like china, they'll have to replace their electrical production.
the other question is: are we making this technology zero emissions?
do we put it in the developed nations?
are we spreading elsewhere?
it's a very important thing.
it's a key element of the pagella.
if you go back, what should the pagella of 2020 look like?
that should have the same two aspects as well.
we should be able to implement efficiency measures to start getting reductions.
the least emit, the less emit is going to be the total amount of co2, and so the temperature.
but the vote in this matter, doing things that don't behave big reductions, has only a major weight, or even slightly lower, to the other, which is the speed of innovation of new inventions.
we need to push these progress to speed, and we can measure speed from companies, pilot projects, regulators.
many optimistic books were written about it.
" the book of al gore, " " the choice, " " is david mckay, " " sustainable energy without hot air. " " "
these books hang out the problem and create context in which to do the debate, because these things need a spread support.
many things have to happen at once.
so i have a wish.
a very important desire that we will invent technology.
if i had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, between: to choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which is very, very much, or realizing this thing that costs half the shore and not produces co2, i would choose this last one.
that's the greatest impact.
if this desire is not going to realize, the fracture between who thinks short and the long term, between the united states and china, between poor and wealth, it's going to be terrible, and most importantly, the life of those two billion people will be far worse.
so what do we have to do?
what am i invited to take the initiative and go?
you need more research support.
when nations come together in places like copenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about co2.
they should also argue the innovation program, and you'd be stupid about how ridiculous we invest in these innovative approaches.
" we need incentives, tax on co2, the" " cap and trade, " " tools that evidence the cost of pollution. "
we need to spread the message.
we need to make this more rational and understandable dialogue, and it has to include government choices.
it's an challenging desire, but i think that's a real thing.
thank you.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. thank you.
thank you. just to know more on earthpower, etc. . .
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
bill gates: making software, buying supercomputer, assume all the great scientists, which we've done, only tens of millions, and even when we're testing materials in a russian reactor, to make sure they're going to work to where we're going to talk about hundreds of
the hard thing is to build the pilot reactor, find billions, the competent authority, the place where it's going to build the first exercise.
once we built the first, if it works as a announced, it will be columbus egg, because costs, the density of energy, are completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
ca: so if i understand well, this means building, ben underground, of a vertical serbator filled with nuclear fuel, of this kind of impoverished uranium.
then the process starts from the top and move towards the bottom?
bg: right. reactors, nowadays, many people, many people, many controls that can't work, opening continue, things that come in and come--
it's not good.
if instead the fuel is very cheap and you can make it for 60 years, i'm going to get in and forget all those complexity.
it's there, burned for sex's years, and then it ends up.
ca: a nuclear plant that's doing by the landfill.
bg: yeah. well, the waste you can leave there then you can take them, put them in another reactor and burn them.
and we're going to start with existing waste, now stored in cool cool or containers near the reactors.
it's going to be our first fuel.
so what was a problem of conventional reactor is going to be the fuel of ours, and the volume of waste will be impressive, as soon as this process is going to be true.
ca: but when do you talk around the world of the potential of this technology, where are most interest in its realization?
bg: well, there's no place in particular, and there's all of these interesting transparency rules about everything that's called nuclear, so we're very interest.
our staff was in russia, india, china.
i just met the segretario for energy.
we talked about how this idea fits to the current program.
they're optimistic. french and japanese have done jobs in this field.
it's a variation about something that has been done.
it's a substantial improvement, but it's a kind of quick reactor, which many nations have already built, so anyone who has already built a quick reactor and a good candidate to welcome our own.
ca: what are the time and the likelihood that something like that?
bg: well, for one of these full-scale projects, which produces energy, that doesn't cost a lot, we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it.
that's thecadence that environmental models demonstrate is tassative.
terrapower, if everything is okay, it's not just wonderful, it could easily meet this goal.
and now there are, fortunately, dozens of companies in the industry, that similarly, if their research works, if the funding for their pilot implants will be erogated, they can compete.
and it's better if a lot of solutions will succeed, because at that point you can see a set of solutions.
it's necessary that at least one success.
ca: when you talk about important innovations, revolutionary, this is the biggest thing you know?
bg: a energy revolution is the most important thing.
it would also be without environmental constraints, but environmental constraints make it much more important.
in the branch of nuclear, there are other innovators.
" we don't know their work well like this, but one is the nuclear" " modular" " nuclear, a different approach. "
there's a liquid reactor. it seems hard to make, but maybe they say the same thing about us.
so there are different, but the cool thing is that a molecule of uranio sprigiona a million times more energy than a molecule of, say, coal, so if you can manage the negative aspects, the potential, in terms of the effects of the environment and more, almost a classroom.
ca: and if it doesn't work, what do we do?
shouldn't we have to start adopting emergence measures to try to keep the earth stable earth?
bg: if you're in that situation, it's kind of like when you eat too much, and you're going to have heart attack.
where do you go to that point? you might need a surgeon or something like that.
there's a whole research line about the geo-engineering, which are various techniques that would slow warming down 20 or 30 years to coordinate action.
it's like a insurance polyes.
hopefully you don't need it.
some people say that you shouldn't even work in polio because it could impigrite you, you're going to keep eating why the surgeon will save you.
i don't think it's a wise choice, and it's the importance of the problem, but now in the course of geo-engineering, you wonder whether you need to hold solutions in the case where events are being praying, or innovations get later later.
ca: climate-skeptical: if i had a sentence or two to tell them, how would you persuade them wrong?
bg: well, unfortunately, there are different types of skepticism and those that advanced scientific topics are very few.
some say there's a negative feedback because of the clouds smoking the effects of warming.
they're very, very, very few things that you can only say that there's a likelihood on a million who are going on here the main problem looks like aids.
i made a mistake now and pay the consequences very much later.
and so, when you're a thousand emergencies, the idea of making sacrifices that you'll see the results just after--
sacrifices not well known.
in fact, the relationship of the ippc doesn't necessarily say the worst case; there's people in the rich world looking at the ippc and says, ok, it's not bad.
the fact is that that uncertainty should be pushed to action.
but my dream is, if we can make it economically, and respect the constraints on co2, then skeptics will say, okay, i don't care if i don't emitting co2, i would almost prefer it, but i'm going to accept it
ca: would that be your answer to the question of bjorn lomborg, which if you invest all your energies trying to solve the problem of co2, your other goals, will be sacrificed, and that puts money, when there are better things to do, means wasted resources stupid
bg: well, the actual research and development--
let's say that u. s. should spend 10 billion more than they do now is not so naive.
it shouldn't distract resources to other purposes.
the things that behave a lot of money, and here also reasonable people could disseminate, are anti-economic solutions.
it's mostly that, i waste it.
unless you're funded the learning curve, getting closer to the point where it's going to become very cheap, i think effort concentrate in technology that have the potential to lower dramatic costs.
" if the alternative was, " " we make the cost-cost energy, so that only the rich can afford it, " " all of the present can afford to pay for energy five times as well without changing lifestyle. "
disaster would be for those two billion.
and even lomborg laughed his positions.
" his topic is, " " why is it not discussing more research and development? " " "
" and for his past, he still turned it into the skepticism, but he realized that it's a very narrow group, and therefore it's raiseing the question of research and development. "
and that's a question i think is appropriate to lift.
it's amazing how little you invest in research and development.
ca: well bill, i think i'm just talking about the majority of the audience saying that i hope to see your wish is becoming reality. thank you.
bg: thank you.
i'd like to share with you a discovery that i did a few months ago when i was writing an article for the italiana wired magazine.
" i've always got my dictionary of the sinonimi taken by hand every time i write something, but i'd finished correcting the paper, and i realized that i never had in my life search for the word" " disabled" " to see what i would find. "
let me read the result.
" " " disability, " " well, communicating, damaged, useless, racing, hurt, packed, packed, packed, mutilated, indebolito, consuming, impoverited, impoverished, castrate, paralyzed, handicap
contrari: in form, strong, skill.
i was reading this list at high-voice voice at a friend, and at the beginning she laughed, she was so ridiculous, but as soon as i read the word mutilated my voice, i had to stop me back to shock and the impact that the lens of these words left me.
you know, we're obviously talking about my old dictionary of sinonimi.
i'm thinking, it's going to be an old edition, right.
but in fact, the date of the edition was early 80.
when i was starting elementary school, and i was forming and learning what existed my family and on things relative to other children and the world around me.
and, useless to say, thank god i wasn't using the dictionary of sinonimi at the time.
i mean, from this explanation seems like i'm born in a world that sees someone like me as one who has nothing positive in any way of them, when, in fact, i'm celebrated for opportunities and adventures that my life has taken.
so, i immediately went to see on the edition 2009 in the network, waiting to find a revision without valuable.
this is the aggiornated version of description.
unfortunately, that's not much better.
" i find the last two words below" " almost opposite" " particularly disappointed, " " the whole" " and" " healthy" " so, it's not just about words. "
that's what we believe about people when we names them with these words.
and by the way, the values behind these words, and how do we build these values.
our language influence our thinking and our view of the world and how we see other people.
in fact, a lot of ancient civilizations, including that greek and that person, believed that offend verbally was more powerful, because to say the high-voice things brought her to existence.
so what realities do we want to get to exist, a person who's limited, or a person with more force?
so randomly doing something simple as a person nominating a person, a child, we could put it on the shadows and get shadows on their strength.
don't we want to open up the door for them?
one person, who opened me the doors, was the doctor of when i was a girl at the dupont institute in wilmington, delaware.
his name is dr. pizzutillo.
italoamericano, whose name, apparently, was too hard to speak for most americans, so it became dr. p.
and dr. p wear always colored colored papillon and had a perfect bias to work with children.
i loved almost anything that i spent in the hospital with the exception of physiological session.
i had to do what looked like infinite exercises of exercise with these large elastic, different colors, to help me build the muscles of the legs.
and i hated these elastics more than anything.
i hate them, i hurt them, really hatred.
and, you know, i knew already treating, like one five years, with dr. p to try to escape from these exercises, incredibly clear.
and one day, she came to one of my tired tires and inexorable, these chairs.
" and he said, " " wow, aimee, you're so strong, i think you're going to break one of them. "
" " " when the puppets, i'll give you 100 dollars. " " "
now, of course, it was just a little handful of dr. p for me to do the exercises that i didn't want to do in front of the perspective of being the most rich girl than the second plan, but, the one that actually did, was to give a different shape to a terrible
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
and i wonder today, the entity of his vision, and its statement about me as a strong girl, redefined my view of myself in a strong, fully and athletes towards the future.
this is an example of how adults with power positions can inflame the force of a child.
but in the example of the first example of the vocabulary of sinonimi, our language doesn't give us the chance to evolve towards the reality that we all want, the possibility of an individual to see himself as a skill.
our language, it wasn't at the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
of course, from a medical perspective, my legs, the laser operations for sight, knees of titanium and even recharble bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and move beyond the ability that nature has imposing them, and allow people to identify their own description of themselves,
so perhaps the technology is getting us now more clearly what was always a truth, that each one has something rare and background to offer our society, and human ability to adapt and our biggest quality.
human ability to adapt, it's something interesting, because people always wanted to talk about insornmontabil difficulties and i have to admit you.
this sentence never went well, and i've always felt in disconnected to respond to people about it, and i think i'm starting to understand why.
and underestimate in this phrase, insormontabile avversity, and the idea that success, or happiness, is reacting from the other side of a challenge without damage or signs of this experience, if my success in life came from a skill and the one of schimine or
but in fact, we've changed, we're branded, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally or both.
and i would suggest that it's a good thing.
the adversity is not an obstacle that we need to act in order to reconcile our lives.
it's part of our life.
and i tend to think it's like my shadow.
and sometimes i think that's a lot, and sometimes almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
and, of course, i'm not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of the suffering of one person.
there are adversity and the challenges in life, and it's all true is true to every single person, but the question is not whether you're going to have adversity or not, but how you're going to face it.
so, our responsibility is not simply protecting people care about adversity, but to prepare them to receive them in the right way.
and we make a damage to our children when we make them feel that they're not ready to adapt.
there's an important difference between the objective factor of being an amputatal person and the subjective opinion of society that will see me disabled or not.
and, in fact, the only major disability i had to face is if the world has ever thought i could be described by those words.
in our desire to protect those that we love to give them a cold, hard truths about their medical prognosing, or, really, the prognosis of their life expectancy, we need to be sure not to put the first brick into a wall that actually disabilities someone.
perhaps the existing model of looking at the one that's broken in you and how to put it in place, can drive the subject that the disease itself.
in not treating a person in the complete, don't make them understand her potential, we're creating another disease addition to the natural suffering they already have.
we're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community.
so we need to see through the disease and inside the list of human capacity.
and most importantly, there's a relationship between those failures perceive and our great creativity.
so, it's not about reluctant, or deny, these numerous searches like something we want to avoid or descend under the carpet, but rather find those unlimited opportunities in an accident.
so maybe the idea i want to explain to you is that there's no idea how to overcome a adversity, how to open it up, to turn it into it, to use a term of free struggle, maybe even dance together.
and maybe, if we look at an accident as a natural thing is useful, we are less overwhelmed by her presence.
this year we celebrate the two compulsory birthday of charles darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when you write about evolution, darwin illustrate, i think, the truth about human character.
and to say that in another way, it's not the strongest of the belief that survives, and it's not even the smartest one, and the one that's most adapted to change.
conflict is the genesi of the cration.
from darwin's work, among other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and develop and drive by suffering of human spirit through conflicts in transformation.
so again, transformation, adaptation, is our biggest quality.
and maybe, until we're trying to test, we don't know what we're made.
maybe this is what gives us the adversity, a sense of conservation, a sense of force.
so, we can make a gift.
we can--imagine adversity as something more difficult than it is.
maybe we can see it as a change.
the adversity is a change that we haven't adapted yet.
i think the biggest adversity we've created is this idea of normal now, who is normal?
there's no normal, there's a typical one. there's no normal.
and would you like to meet those poor gray people if they existed?
i don't think so.
if we change this paradigm from one on how to get normality to one of the possibility, or potentially, to be adirive a little bit more dangerous, we can understand the strength of so many children, and invite them to join their precious capacity with the community.
anthropologists teach us that that thing that we, as humans, have always wanted to be for the members of our community and to help, to contribute.
there's an evidence that in holland, 60, 000 years ago, carried to the triumph and subjects with severe wounds, and perhaps because of the experience and the survival of these people was the evidence of the value of the community: they didn't see these people as broken or useless;
a few years ago, i was in a city town market where i grew up in that red area in the east of pennsylvania.
and i was in front of a tomato pomodori.
it was summer, and i had cort pants out of it.
" i heard this guy, his voice behind me said, " " but, it's not aimee mullins, " " and i turned to myself, and there's this middle-aged man. i had no idea who it was. "
" and i said, " " excuse ladies, do you know? i don't remember i ever met her, " " he said, " " but, you won't remember you've met me. "
" i mean, when we met you, i was born from your mother's belly. " " "
oh, that guy.
and, of course, in fact, it played me a bell.
that gentleman was dr. kean, a man who i had only known from my mother's stories on that day, because, clear, typically, i got late for two weeks.
and so, the mushroom ostetric mushroom of my mother went to holiday, so the man born me was a complete strange for my parents.
and because i was born without the perone, and i had the feet out of it, some fingers in this foot, and some in that, he had to be the message, this stranger had to deliver bad news.
" he said, " " i had to give this prognosing to your parents that you would never walk, and that you would never have the kind of mobility that have other children or any kind of independent lives, and you gave me a bugiard since then, " " laughter the thing that' s
which i had marched with the girl scout, you know, halloween's sfiltrate, who i won my studio scholarship, or all my airplanes, and used them, and they were teaching students from his course, and they taught his medical school medical school of hahnemann and
and it's called this part of the course, the x-factor, the potential of human will.
there's no prognosis can see how much it is to be and how it's determined in the quality of a person's life.
" and dr. kean continued to explain to me, and he said, " " in my experience, unless he's told him, and even though he's given a briciola of support, if he's left to himself, a child comes in. " " "
so dr. kean changed his opinion.
it understood that there's a difference between medical condition and what everyone can do with it.
and there was a change in my thinking during the years, in this, if you asked me when i was 15 years old, if i had prosthetics with legs in meat and bone wouldn't make a second.
i dreamed that kind of normality at the time.
if you ask me today, i'm not sure.
and it's because of the experiences that i've had with them, not for their experiences that i had with them.
and perhaps, the change in me has happened because i've been exposed to people who opened me the door of the ones that had hurt me.
you see, all you need is a person who's going to show you the epiphany of your own potential, and you're designed if you can give someone the keys of their strength, the human spirit is so reluctant, if you can do it and open a door for someone in a
you're teaching them open your doors.
" in fact, the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root" " extract" " which means, pull out what's inside, to get the potential to get the potential. "
so again, what is the potential we want to pull out?
there was a case in the 1960s in grand bretagna, when they were given from elementary school at average.
" it's called" " continuity, " " we call it" " alignment here in the united states. "
it means separating students depends on their vote.
" and the students with the best votes have a tougher program, and better teachers, well, they did it for a period of three months, students with voting insufficiente gave him the" " good" " said they were good, who were smart. "
" and at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results at the level of" " optimist" " and, of course, the sad lights of this study, is that they took the students from" " optics" " told them they were" " insufficiente" "
the ones that had left to school, as well as the ones i left.
the critical part of this study was that teachers were deceived.
teachers didn't know that this change was done.
he just told him, these are the good students, and these are the ones who are insufficiente.
and so that's how they started teaching them.
so, i think true disability is to have a damaged spirit, and a damaged spirit doesn't have hope.
you can't see beauty.
it's no longer our natural, child curiosity and our innate capacity to imagine.
if we can sustain the human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be imaginative and curious, allori is using our strength correctly.
when the spirit has these qualities, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
i want to leave you with a poem written by a poet persian poet called hafiz who made me know my friend jacques dembois.
" and the poem is called, " " the god who knows only four words" " " " every child knew god, not the names's god, not the god of the names, but the god who only knows four words is continuing to repeat them, saying, " " come to dance with me" "
thank you.
