last year, i showed these slides to demonstrate that the arctic ice cream, which for nearly three million years has had the size of 48 continental united states, it was 40 percent.
yet this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice.
the arctic iceland is, in a way, the heart of the global climate system.
it expands in winter, and it gets summer.
the next slide is going to be a quick carrellat on the edge of the last 25 years.
the glaciers for the time i went to red.
as you can see, they expand to the dark blue.
that's the ice in winter, which is rhythming summer.
you can see that the called per-year-old ice, for five years or more, is like blood, which is coming out of the body.
in the age of 25, it's been past like this.
this is a problem because heating the glacier soil around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of frozen coal that, melting, are turned into methane from the microbes.
compared to the totality of global pollution from global warming, that amount could double, overheading this non-return.
in some deep deep-down lakes in alaska, methane is already cut off the water.
the professor katey walter of university of university of alaska came up with a team at a low lake last winter.
video: wow! al gore: she's okay. the question is if we're going to be.
one reason is that this thermal exchangeer surriscalcalt greenland from north.
this is a river in glacial regime.
the scale had never reached similar levels.
this is the kangerlussuaq river, south-west of greenland.
if you want to know how the sea level goes up to the shrimp melting of the glaciers on land, here's where the sea is.
these currents are rapidly growing.
on the other side of the planet: antarctica, the largest block of ice on the planet.
last month, scientists said that the ice budget is in the negative, is that the west antarctica, that pumps on some underwater islands, is particularly quick in the melting.
it's six meters of water level, like greenland.
on the himalayas, the third largest block of ice, you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population was half of drinking water from that melting.
on the ande: this glacier is the source of drinking water of this city.
the scale has increased.
but when they decrease, the same thing happens to the drinking water.
in california, the snow on sierra nevada has dropped 40 percent.
the water bacinis are in crisis.
predictions, as you read, are severe.
growing safeness in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the fires.
environmental disasters are increasing at a pace outside of normal and unprecedented.
four times more numerous in the last 30 years compared to the previous 75.
this is an unsustainable way.
if you look at it in the historic context, you can see the consequences.
over the last five years, we added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours--25 million tons in the ocean every day.
look carefully the area of the eastern pacific, from americas, west, and on both parts of the indian subcontinent, where there is a radical oxygen impoveriment in the ocean.
the biggest cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent, is fossil fuel use.
oil is a problem, and coal is even worse.
the united states are one of the two countries with more emissions, along with china.
and he was able to build a lot of other coal plants.
but we're seeing a direction shift.
these are the drought projects over the last few years and some of the green alternatives.
anyway, there's a political struggle in our country.
coal and oil industries spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote clean coal, which is a bone.
that image reminds me of something--
towards christmas, in tennessee, where i live, there was a loss of three. 8 billion lit liters of coal scories.
maybe you've seen it on news news.
this is the second largest flow of scories in america.
it happened around christmas.
the advertiser of one of the coal industries was this.
" video: " " frosty the carbonaio is a crushing guy and happy guy. "
it's abundant here in america, and it's growing our economy.
frosty the carbonaio is always cleaner.
it's good price, it's adorable and workers keep the salary.
al gore: that's a lot of the coal of west virginia.
the largest mining societies on mountains is massey coal. this is its ceo.
video: don blankenship: i'm clear--al gore, nancy pelosi, harry reid--they don't know what they're talking about.
al gore: so the alliance of climate protection launched two campaigns.
this is one of them, one part.
video: actor: at coalergy, we see climate change as a serious threat to our business.
so our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on coal.
actually, coal is not dirty.
we think it's clean--it's got good smell.
so don't worry about climate change.
let's leave us.
video: actor: clean coal--you've heard a lot.
so let's take a turn around in a cutting-edge structure for how much clean coal is.
amazing! machines are a little noisy, but this is the sound of clean coal technology.
coal consumption is among the major causes of global warming, but the remarkable clean coal technology that you see everything.
take a look. this is the clean clean technology today.
al gore: finally, the positive alternative connects to the economic question and national security.
video: commento: america is in crisis; economics, national security, climate crisis.
the wire that connects them all: our dependence of fossil fuels, such as coal sporc and oil.
now, there's a new, audacious solution to come out.
repower america: 100 percent clean energy in 10 years.
a plan to put america back to work, make us safer, and help stop global warming.
finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
repower america. you find more.
al gore: this is the last one.
video: commento: it's about energy to america.
one of the fastest ways to end addiction from fuel that kill our planet.
so the future is here. wind, sun, a new energy network.
i'm going to go back# 2: new investments for working jobs.
commento: repower america. it's time to be realistic.
" al gore: an old african tube says, " " if you want to go fast, go alone. "
" if you want to go distant, go together. " " "
we need to go distant, quickly.
thank you very much.
last year at ted took a introduction on the lhc.
it's promised to return to update you about how the machine works.
so here's it. and for those that didn't have, lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted--27 kilometers of circumstance.
his task is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second from the beginning of the universe--up to 600 million times per second.
this is just ambitious.
this is the geneva machine.
let's take these mini-big bangs inside the detectors.
this is what i work on. it's called atlas--it's 44 meters, and it's got 22 meters diameter.
this is a spectacular image of atlas in construction so you can see proportions.
the september 10 of the last year, we turned the car for the first time.
and this picture was taken by atlas.
it was caused by immense parties in control room.
it's an image of the first bunch of particles that had done all over the lhc, entering collision, deliberately, with a part of the lhc, and spreading particles inside the detector.
in other words, when we saw that image of september, we realized that the machine worked, which is a great victory.
i don't know if that was to make us exult more or this, when someone went to google and saw that the initial page was this.
that means that we've had a cultural impact beyond that scientific.
about a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because of these wires here--these dorati wires.
these wires bring 13, 000 of them adjust when the machine works at the most of the power.
" now, the technicians between you look at the wires and will say, " " it's not true. it's too thin filters. " " "
and instead they can do it because when they're very cold, they become the superconductor filters.
so, at least less degrees, at a lower temperature to the space of stars, these wires can bring that current.
in one of the most nine, 000 magnets in the lhc, there was a perfect factory.
so the wires get slightly, and the 13, 000 of them suddenly met an electrical resistance.
this was the result.
now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets weighed more than 20 tons, and they moved from about 30 centimeters.
they have damaged about 50 magnets.
we had to take it away, which we then did.
we restore them and add it.
now they're all coming back to their place underground.
by march, the end of march, the lhc will be back again.
we're going to turn it on, and we expect to get data at june or july, and continue our adventure to find out what the bricks are that costs the universe.
now, of course, in a certain way, these accidents get the debate on the value of science and engineering engineering. it's easy to confunction.
i think the fact that it's so hard, the fact of going beyond limits, i think that's the value of things like lhc.
" i'd like to finish with the words of a british scientist, humphrey davy, who, i imagine, in defense of the useless experience of his pupillo, his pupil was michael faraday, said, " " nothing is so dangerous for human mind's progress than
thank you.
i want to start by asking you to rethink when, from children, you play with the building blocks.
as you can understand how to reach them and grab them, grab them and move them, you learn how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulate space relationships.
spatial reason is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
" so as a computer science inspired by the usefulness of our interaction with physical objects, along with my potent pathti, and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi, i started to ask myself, " " and if, when we use a computer, instead of having the only cursor of mouse
is it going to fix it?
the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the siftable.
in a few words, a siftable is a interactive computer as a cookie.
in a few words, a siftable is a interactive computer as a cookie.
you can move with your hand, they can see their movement, feel their motion and have a screen and a wireless radio.
but above all, they're physical objects, like the blocks, you can just move them up.
siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information.
and as they become more physical, conscious of their movement, of others, and as they become more physicists, more movement, of others, how we move them, we can explore new and fun benefits of interaction.
i'm going to start with some simple example.
this isftable and configured to show videos: if you decline it in one direction, the video steals like this, if you decline from the other side back.
these interactive portraits are aware of others.
if you react to them, you care about what's around them.
if they're surrounded, they notice it and they can shake it a little bit.
if they're surrounded, they notice it and they can shake it a little bit.
they also have their movement and biased.
" and then we realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction was to be able to use common gestures on data, for example, " " versare" " a color as if it was liquid. "
in this case, we've got three strings configured as a paint of paint, and i can use them to pour color in that central, where they measure.
and i can use them to pour color in the middle of that central, where they mix.
if we go too much, we can put it back a little bit.
there are also beautiful learning possibilities, like languages, math and logical games where people can try things fast, and see the results immediately.
now i am--
this is a sequence of fibonacci that i do with a equations program.
here we have a word game that's half of the beetle and boggle.
basically, every shift get a letter in random on each siftable, basically, every shift get a letter to random on each siftable, and while you're trying to combine words, he controls it on a dictionary.
and then, after about 30 seconds, they're getting rid of it, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
thank you.
so here's the children came to the media lab, and i made them prove and made a video.
they're very enjoyable.
and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
" you just have to say, " " make words, " " and they know exactly what to do. "
here are other people trying it.
this is our youngest beta tester, right there on the right.
he actually wanted to stab them.
it was just mattoncini, for him.
now, this is an application of interactive card.
we wanted to build a tool for language learning and happiness.
it can put new characters in the scene, raise the siftable shapes.
it can put new characters in the scene, raise the siftable shapes.
so, it's making the sun out.
video: the sun is selling.
david merrill: now it's got a sudden in the scene.
video: orange trattor.
good job! yes!
so by shaking the siftable and putting them neighbors can interact characters--
video: bau!
invent your story.
video: hi!
dm: it's an open open story, and it can decide him.
dm: it's an open open story, and it can decide him.
video: fly away, cat.
dm: the last example that i have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to sample music.
it's a tool, made recently, to sample and perform music.
theftables here act as a base, low and battery.
every one of them has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
you can also put these sounds into a sequence to compose your pleasure.
" and they just change it by touching a" " sound" " and a sequence. " " "
these are actually that you can control live, like riverbero and filter.
the attacks to a particular sound and then biased to fix it.
and then there are the general effects as time and volume, which apply to the whole sequence.
let's look at how it works.
" dm: dm: we're going to start putting a base in two sequences" " sequence, " " we systems in a series, we're aesthetic, we add other base. "
now i'm going to put a low line.
video: dm: now i'm talking about percussioni--
video: dm: and now i'm going to put the battery filter, so i can control the effect from the live.
video: dm: i can speed the whole sequence inclined time on one side or on the other.
video: dm: and now i'm going to add the bottom filter to make more expression.
" video: dm: i can recombine the" " flight sequence. " " "
so i don't have to plan it first, but i can improvise, make it longer or longer.
" and now, finally, i can shrink the whole sequence on the left on the left the" " volumeble" " . "
thank you.
so, as you can see, my passion is to build new human-machine interfaces more and more similar to how our brain is body.
and today, i've had time to show you one of the results of this journey, and also some possibilities that we're trying to bring out the lab.
the concept i want to convey you is that this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media, which will take information in our world in the way we want.
thank you very much.
i can't see the time to talk to you all.
i'm a writer.
writing books is my profession, but that's more than that, of course.
it's also love and the fascination of my life.
and i don't expect it to change.
but said this, something particular happened recently in my life and my career, that led me to regulate the entire relationship with this work.
" and the particular thing is that i recently wrote this book, this biography called" " eat, praying, love" " which, unlike my previous books, for some reason out of the world and became a big, sensational, bestseller interazionale. "
and the result is that everywhere i'm going to go now, people are treated me as if i was condemned.
really--condannaty, condannaty!
" now they're all worried, and they're like, " " don't you fear that you can't do better? "
" you're not afraid to keep writing all of your life without able to be able to create a book that can matter to someone? " " "
" what can anyone care? " " "
it's reassuring, you know.
but it could go worse, except that i remember more than 20 years ago, when i started to say people--i was a teenager--which i wanted to be a writer.
i went to the same response based on fear.
" and people said to me, " " don't you fear how to succeed? "
are you not afraid that the humiliation of rejection kill you?
" you're not afraid you're going to do all of your life without having nothing outside of it is to die on a cow of infrant dreams with the mouth full of love failure? " " "
so, you know.
" the answer--the short answer to all of these questions is, " " yes. " " "
yes, i'm afraid of all those things.
i've always had fear.
and i also fear of many other things that people can't guess.
like algae and other scary things.
but, what about writing what i thought and i asked myself lastly and why?
is it rational?
it's logical that anyone who needs to be scared from a job that feels born to do.
but what's so peculiar in creative businesses that makes us nervous about mental healthcare in a way that other careers don't do?
like my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer, and i don't remember once in his 40 years of activities where he asked him if he was afraid to be engineered?
never--that block of the john's engineer, as it goes?
it didn't work like that, you know?
honestly, chemical engineers like group don't certainly have, in centuries, earn the reputation of being a depressed decline.
we writers, we have enough reputation, and not just writers but creatives of all kinds, we have this reputation to be enormously unstable mentally.
and it's nothing else to look at the sad wiring of the magnificent creative minds that only in the twentieth century, died young and often for them.
and even the ones who are not suicidated seems to be really unexpected by their own doni.
" norman mailer, before she died, the last interview said, " " every book killed me a little bit more" " an extraordinary statement about her life's work. "
but we don't beat it when we hear it because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have totally internal and accept the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow related and art, ultimately, will always lead to anguish.
and the question i want to ask you today is: do you agree with this idea?
it's okay to do that--because even look at a centimeter away from me, it's not good for anything that's assumptions.
i think it's hatred.
and i think it's also dangerous, and i don't want to see it perpetual in the next century.
i think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live.
and i certainly know that in my case--in my situation--it would be very dangerous to start to escape to that dark path of assumptions, above all given the circumstances that i'm in my career.
that is--you know, i'm pretty young, i've got about 40 years old.
i still have about four jobs in me.
and it's very likely that anything i'm going to write right now, and then it's going to be judged by the world as the work that came out after the scary success of my last book.
i'm glad, because we're all about friends here--it's likely my biggest success is behind my shoulders.
oh, jesus, thought!
you know, that's the kind of thought that leads a person to start drinking gin to nine in the morning and i don't want to.
i'd like to keep doing this work i love.
so the question becomes, how?
and so it seems to me, after many reflection, that the way we work to keep writing is to create a protective psychological construct, ok?
i have to somehow find a security distance between me, which i'm writing, and my natural anxiety of which reaction that one written will be able to get is, as i was looking for the whole year of how i could start looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could
how to help creative people manage the emotional risks of creativity.
and that research led me to ancient greece and ancient rome.
follow me off, because it turns out to circle and then come back.
in ancient greece and ancient rome--people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men, ok?
you thought that creativity was this spirit looking at it, and it came to men from some kind of strange and strange, for distant reasons and unknown.
the greeks called these guardiani spirit spirits of the demoni creativity.
socrate, wonderfully, he believed that he had a demon that was taken wisdom from distant.
the romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius.
which is great, because the romans didn't really think that a genius was a particularly intelligent one.
they believed that a genius was this kind of divina entity that believed were literally in the walls of the studio of an artist, a little bit like the elf dobby, and that came out to hiding the work of the artist and model the result of that work.
amazing--that's the distance of which i'm talking about--that psychological construct that protects you from your job results.
and everybody knew that this was how it worked, right?
so the ancient artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcissism, right?
if your work was amazing, you couldn't take the whole thing, everybody knew you were helped from this genius incored.
if your failed work, it wasn't your fault, right?
everybody knew that it was your genes to be an incapace.
and so people have designed creativity in the west for a long time.
then the renaissance came and all changed, and it was this great idea; we put human being at the center of the universe above all of the gods and the mysteries and no longer leave space to the mitiche creatures that write detail from the divinity.
this was the principle of rational human beings, and people began to think that creativity was completely from idividuo.
and for the first time in history, you start to think about this or that artist as a genius rather than a person with genes.
and i have to tell you, i think it was a big mistake.
i think allowing someone, a simple person to believe that it's like a recipient like the source, the essence and the source of all the divini, creativity, in strangeble and eternity is a responsibility that's too big to give to human fragile.
it's like asking someone to inject the sun.
deforma is completely distorted ego and creates all of these expectations about performance.
and i think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
and, if that's true, and i think it' s, the question becomes, is it now?
can we do that differently?
maybe go back to a oldest understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery.
or maybe not.
maybe we can't delete 500 years of rational thinking in a 18-minute talk.
and there's probably people in the audience that will lift scientific legitimate legitimate on the notion of, you know, you're going to follow people digitized on their projects.
i'm probably not going to convince you all on this.
but the question i'd like to ask is--why not?
why don't we think that way?
because it has more sense than any other thing that i've ever heard of explaining the excitement of the creative process.
a process that, like anybody who's ever tried to do something--so basically, everybody here--sa, not rationally.
and, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely paranormal.
i made this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetessa ruth stone, who's 90 years old, but that was a poetessa for all life, and he told me that during his childhood in rural virginia, he worked out in the field, and he felt, within themselves, when a poem came from
he told me it was like a fragorous air train.
and that was coming down towards her landscape.
he felt it, because he had shaking the earth under his feet.
" she knew she had one thing to do at that point, and she was, words sue, " " run like a matt. " " "
and so he ran home and he was chasing from this poem, and he wouldn't have to do anything to take a piece of paper and a pencil quite quickly from, while he'd caught it, pick it up and grab it on the page.
" other times he couldn't be fast enough, so he correct and correct and correct without being able to get to the house, and the poem would roll it through and she lost her and would keep on the landscape through the landscape, looking for, as she said, " " another poet. " " "
then there were times--this piece never forget--there were moments where it was almost losing, right?
so, he was running home and he was looking for paper and poetry passed it through, and he grabbed a pencil right in the while he was going through, and then he said, it was as though he would walk with the other hand and the chase.
she was welcomed the poem from the tail and put it back into her body and transmitted her page.
and in these cases, poetry would be presented to the perfect page, but instead, from the last word to the first one.
so when i heard that--it's crazy, it's exactly the same as my creative process.
not all my creative process--i'm not a concentrate!
i'm a mulo, and my way to work is; wake up at the same time and sweat and work and overwhelmingly.
but even i, in my headrdaggine, i've crawled against that thing, sometimes.
and i guess most of you have done it.
you know, even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source, i couldn't honestly know that.
and what is this thing?
and how can we relate to it so that we can't lose your head, but rather, how do we get healthy?
as far as i'm concerned, the best contemporary example i have is tom waits musician, which i interviewed several years ago for a newspaper.
we were talking about this, and you know, tom, for most of our lives was the incarnation of contemporary artist tormentration, trying to control, manage, dominate these species of totally internal impulses.
but then older, we're warm, and one day while he was driving on a highway in los angeles, he changed everything for him.
he was going fast, and all of a sudden he feels like this little piece of melody, which comes in his head as a inspiration, elusive and fractal, and he wants, you know, it's wonderful, it's desire, but he doesn't know how to take
it doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a pencil, it doesn't have a recorded.
" so it starts to feel this kind of anxiety species growing in him, " " i'm going to lose it, and i'm obsessed with this persempre song. "
" i'm not good enough, and i can't do it. " " "
and instead of going to panic, we stop.
we stop the whole mental process and did something completely new.
" i just look at the sky and said, " " sorry, do you see i'm driving? " " "
" " " does it seem to write a song now? "
if you really want to exist, come back to a more opportunities when i can take care of you.
otherwise, you're going to import someone else today.
" you go to leonard cohen. " " "
and his working process changed after that.
not work, work was still dark as well.
but the process, and the heavy anxiety that actrniava had been released when he took the genius, the genius who came out of him caused nothing more than the problem and the free will send it back from where they were, realizing that he didn't have to be a interiorized and
but it turns out that peculiar, wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between tom and this weird and external thing that wasn't tom.
so how much i heard that story began to change a little bit the way i worked and already once.
" and this idea, i'm going to get when i was writing" " eat, praying, love, " " is caddied in one of the cave of despair where we're all going on when we're working on something and we can't do something about it, and we
not just bad, just the worst book written.
and i started to think of this project.
but then i remembered tom talking about air and tried.
so i got my face up in the manuscript and i would say my comments at a vacuum angle of the room.
" and i said to high voices, " " look, what, both of us know that if this book won't be brilliant, it won't be entirely my fault, right? "
because as i see, i'm putting everything i have, i don't have any more than that.
so if you want it to be better, you've got to present and make your part.
okay. but if you don't do that, you know what, i don't care about it.
i'm going to keep writing the same because it's my job.
" and i'd like to please find that it was recorded that i've been told to make my part, " " why--eventually it's so, ok--centuries in the deserts of northern africa, people were coming up with danze to the moon, danze and
and they were always wonderful, because dancers were professional professionals and they were great.
but every once, rarely, something happened, and one of these artists became actually transcendent.
and i know you know what i'm talking about, because i know you all seen it, at some point, a performance like this.
it was as though time stops, and the dancer walked through a kind of portal, and it wasn't doing anything different from usually, like 1, 000 nights, but everything was aligned.
and suddenly it doesn't just look like a human.
but it embraced from the backyard and from undersea in the fire of the divinity.
and when this happened, at times, people knew what it was, they called him her name.
" they would add their hands and start singing, " " allah, allah, allah, god, god, god. " " "
that's god, you know.
" curiosa historic note--when the south of spain, they took this habit with them and they're calling it to centuries from" " allah, allah, " " to" " ole, ole, ole, " " which you can still hear in the corrupt or flamen
" in spain, when an artist has done something impossible and magical, " " allah, ole, ole, allah, magnificent, good, " " incomprehensible, here it is--one of god. "
and it's great because we need it.
but the problem comes the next day, for the dancer itself, when you wake up and discover that they're 11 of the tuesday tuesday, and god's last no longer.
it's simply a deadly dead mortal to the knees, and maybe never be able to go down to that height.
and maybe nobody can raise the name of god again as it turns out, and so what has to do with the rest of his life?
it's hard.
this is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
but maybe it doesn't have to be so angosciante if you can't believe, by the way, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself.
but you just believe that there are borrowing you're borrowing by a unimaginable source of this shuisity part of your life that you have to spend to somebody else when you finished.
and, you know, if we think about it everything changes.
and so i started to think about it, and it's definitely the way i thought it was for several months in the work of the book that's going to publish soon, dangerous, scary, scared, followed by my great success.
and what i've got to keep telling me when i feel electrifying from this is, i don't fear.
don't encourage you. it's just your job.
it continues to present you for your part, whatever it is.
if your job is dancing, dancing.
" if the dive, absurd genius to tear decides to let some kind of wonder, for a single moment through your efforts, then" " ole! " " "
otherwise, do your dance.
" it' s" " ole! " " at you. "
i believe it and i think it should teach it.
" " " ole! " " to you the same, even just for having human love and headaches such to make you present all the time. "
thank you.
thank you.
june cohen: ole!
as you know, i've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it means is about discovery of new set of genes.
now we're starting to start a new path. we started digitizing biology, and now starting from that digital code, we're entering a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing life.
we've always tried to ask big questions.
" " " what is life? " " it's something that many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. "
we tried different approaches, reducing to minimi terms.
we are digitized for almost 20 years now.
when we sequenced the human genome, it was about going from the analogus world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
now we ask ourselves: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe?
this is the map of a little organism, mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between the lab.
and we tried to reduce the genome to create a smaller one.
we're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here.
but when we look at his metabolic map, it's relatively simple than our own map.
believe me, this is simple.
but when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate, one at a time, it's very unlikely that this can lead to a living cell.
so we decided that the only way to move was to synthesize this chromosome so that we can change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions.
" and so we started the adventure of" " can we synthesize a chromosome? " " "
can chemistry allow us to produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
and in case it says, can we make a chromosome work?
a chromosome is simply a piece of chemical chemical material.
the speed that we are able to digitize life is growing at exponential pace.
our ability to write the genetic code instead, rather slowly promising, but it's getting better.
and our latest results take it on an exponential curve.
we started over 15 years ago.
the process took a lot of steps, starting with a bionic review before we started the first experiments.
but we found that synthesize dna is very difficult.
there are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce little dna segments, the length of 30 to 50 letters, and it's a degenerative process: the more segment and longer, the more mistakes there are.
so we had to develop a new way to assemble these fragments and correct mistakes.
and this was our first attempt, starting from digital information from phi x 174 genoma.
it's a little virus killing bacteria.
we designed the fragments, making the correctness of mistakes and got a dna molecule of about 5, 000 letters.
the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical chemical material and we put it in the bacteria, the bacteria started reading this genetic code and produce viral particles.
viral particles have been released from cells, and they went back and they destroyed e. coli.
i've been talking recently with members of oil industry telling him that they certainly understood this model.
they laughed more than you.
we think this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
but we wanted to make things bigger.
we wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacterium.
they're more than 2, 000 letters of genetic code.
so we thought we're going to build it in cassette of virus size, so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of living cell.
design is crucial, and if we start digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate.
when we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, standards was a mistake for every 10, 000 base.
we found, risequencing, 30 mistakes. if we used that original sequence, we would never be able to make it work.
one part of the process is to design 50 letters that are overlapping with all the other 50-letter segments to build smaller and more small opportunity working together.
we design unique elements here.
you've probably read that we're going to teach us about filigrana.
think about it like this: we have a genetic code based on four letters: a, c, g and t.
three of those letters, they code around 20 amminoacities, and there's a specific order of letters for every pedestrian.
so we can use the genetic code to write words, phrases, thoughts.
what we've done at the beginning was self-caring.
some of them were disappointed that it wasn't poetry.
we designed these segments to simply bring them to enzymes.
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
and we started to assemble parts, starting with five-to-seven-and-a-half-letter segments, so that we can form 24, 000 letters in order to get to 72, 000 letters.
every step, we've produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence because we're trying to create an extremely robust process--as you'll see in a minute.
we're trying to automate the process.
so that seems like the table of a basketball playoff.
when we get to these very long segments, more than 100, 000 basics, they're not going to grow directly into e. coli.
you get to the limit of modern molecular biology.
so we looked at other mechanisms.
we knew about another mechanism called omologa ricombination, which in biology is used to repair the dna that can join the segments.
here's an example.
this organism called the lenococcus radiodurans, can absorb three million rads of radiation.
you can see in the top box like his chromosome is destroyed.
in 12 to 24 hours it's being reacted like it was before.
there are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
these organisms can completely dry.
they can live under empty.
i'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and it's going to move forward to find new rich environments of water.
actually, nasa has shown that this is happening.
this is an image of the molecule that we've built using these processes, simply using the yeast with the appropriate design of chemicals to put together.
yes, the yeast automatically assemble them automatically.
this image was not taken with an electronic microscope, but with a regular microscope.
it's a big molecule that we can see with a light microscope.
these are pictures that cover about six seconds.
this is the publication we did a little bit ago.
they're more likely, 000 letters of genetic code.
it's the largest molecule of a structure called a human.
it has a higher molecular weight in 300 million.
if we were to print it with a 10-space character, it would take 142 pages just to transfer this genetic code.
now, how do we work? how can we activate it?
of course, through a virus and a game from kids.
it's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria.
it's easier when it comes to eucariote cells like ours: you can just extract the core and put another, which is basically the cloning process.
in archaea bacteria, the chromosome is instead integrated inside the cell, but we recently showed that we are able to make a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it.
we purified a chromosome from a microbial species.
the two are different than men from mice.
we added some gene more so that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome.
and then he slipped it with enzymes so we can kill all the proteins.
and when we put it in the cell was great--and you appreciate our sophisticated graph--the new chromosome went inside the cell.
and initially, we thought we couldn't go further, but we tried to push it further.
this is one of the biggest evolution mechanisms.
we found that many species added a second or a third chromosome somewhere, adding in a second thousand new traits to that species.
so who thinks about evolution as a gene at a time it's not understanding most of biology.
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that even digest dna.
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one.
the cell--the chromosome that we put--it has it.
he expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome as a strange material, chewing it, and we found ourselves with only the cell and the new chromosome.
it became blue because of the genes we've put.
and in a short period of time, all the characteristics of a species went lost, and it turned it into a new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell.
all the proteins are changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we've moved to.
now, this may seem like genetic patterns, but by altering the software dna, we can change things quite substantially.
now, i've already explained that this isn't about genesis--but progress coming from three million years and a half million years, and i've already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of cambrian explosion where they're going to create new species based on
why do this?
i think it's pretty obvious when we think about our needs.
we're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
just to give one example: i was born in 1946.
now there are three people on the planet for each existing existing in 1946; in 40 years, there will be four.
we're having problems now to find food, fresh water and clean, drugs and gasoline for six billion and a half billion people.
it's going to be more tougher than nine billion.
we use more than 5 billion coals, more than 30 billion oil barrels.
that means 100 million barrels a day.
when we try to find biological processes, or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge.
the more we need to keep the whole carbon emission from these materials ends up in the atmosphere.
today, thanks to scientific discoveries all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and i like to think that's the design components for the future.
the electronics industry only has a dozen components, and think about how many different things came out.
our limits here are principtical data from biological reality and our imagination.
now we have techniques, thanks to these quick ways of synthetic ways, able to create what we call combinatorial genomics.
we're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
think about processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize the processes to produce ottano or drugs, new vaccines, we can change, thanks to a small team, and create more molecular biology now than in the last 20 years of science.
and it's just a standard selection.
we can choose for survival, chemical production or fuel, vaccines production.
this is an instant of some software software that we're working on to be able to sit down and design species to the computer.
well, we don't necessarily know how they're going to be.
we know exactly how their genetic code is.
now we're focusing on fourth generation fuels.
you've seen you that extract ethanol from wheat was a finite experiment.
we have fuels of second and third generation that will come pretty soon from the sugar of higher fuels like get it or different types of couch.
but the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limit the willingness would be to turn co2 into matter before, so we're working on designing cells that can achieve this goal, and we think we can have the first generation fuel in about 18 months.
solar light combined with co2 is a method--but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
this is an organism that we described in 1996.
she lives in the deep ocean, about 10 meters of depths to the temperature of water.
it creates methane from co2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy.
we're trying to understand whether we can channel co2, which can easily be transported by tubi, convert that co2 into fuel, to drive this process.
so we think we might be able to increase what the basic question" " what life" " is, really, really--we have the modest goal to replace the entire oil industry.
exactly. if you can't do it from ted, where can you?
it would become a major source of energy.
also, we're working on using the same methods to create instant vaccines.
you saw this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to finding the right vaccine.
i think that can change and building combinable vaccines in advanceable.
this is how the future might start to look like changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria, archei, and finally eucariote cells.
we are so much from improving people.
our goal is to make a long way of living enough to try and make it. thank you very much.
first of all, i'm going to show you, as quickly as possible, some fundamental work, of the new technology that we brought to microsoft later on a acquisition almost a year ago. this is seadragon.
it's a environment where you can interact both at the local level and remotely with a huge amount of visual data.
so here we're seeing a lot of digital photoytes with a kind of constant zooming and continuous zooming, for a quick panoramic, i've got images like we want.
and it doesn't matter how big the amount of information we see, how big the data is or images are.
most of them are common digital photographs, but this is an scanning from the library of congress, and comes back into the range of 300 megapixels.
it doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time. it's also a very flexible architecture.
this is a whole book, for example of data not imagery.
this is the home of dickens. each column represents a chapter.
to demonstrate that it's just text and not images, we can do something like this, to really see that it's a real representation of text, not a picture of a picture.
it could be a little bit artificial to read an electronic book.
i'm not advice.
this is a more realistic example. this is a number of guardian.
every big image is the beginning of a section.
and it really gives you the pleasure and the nice experience to read the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is for nature a lot of a medium.
we also did something with the corner of this particular number of the guardian.
we created a high-resolution ad-resolution ad-resolution commercial--much higher than what you use in a normal commercial--and we put you on the extra content.
if you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see them here.
or other models, or even the specific techniques.
and that really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
we hope that this means to put end up to pop-up and other similar porcheries, shouldn't be needed anymore.
of course, mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
and on this one i don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributions to give in this field.
these are all the streets in the u. s. overhead above a nasa geospatial image.
so now let's go to something else.
now this is actually live on the web; you can go see it.
this is a project called photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
one is seadragon, and the other one is a very interesting visual research done by noah snavely, a student from university of washington, with the help of steve seitz of the uw and rick szeliski of microsoft research. a great collaboration.
and it's live on the web, run by seadragon.
you can see it when we do this kind of screen, where we can move from one image to the other and have this kind of multi-resolution experience.
but the space colleague of the images here actually has meaning.
computer visualization algorithms have recorded these images together, so that corresponds to real places where images--all taken near the fatigue lakes on the canadian mountains--they've been taken. so here you see some elements of a slide-show stable or panoramic imaging imaging, and these
i don't know if i have time to show you some other environment.
there are a few more spatial.
i want to move directly to one of the original data set of noah--and this comes from a previous prototype of photosynth that we've worked for the first time last summer--to show you what i think is really the key behind this technology, photosynth technology. and it' s
we had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
this is a reconstruction of notre dame images taken by flickr. you just type notre dame in flickr and you get images of different in maglietty, some of the campus and traveling. each one of these oranges represents an image that's discovered in this model.
so they're all images taken from flickr, and they're all connected to space level like this.
and you can navigate this very simple way.
you know, i never thought i'd end up working for microsoft.
it's very gratifying to receive this kind of mating here.
i think you can see that it's a lot of different types of cameras: from those cell phones to slr professionals, a significant number, put together in this environment.
and if i can, try to find those stranger.
many of them are stuck with faces, etc.
somewhere here is a series of photographs--that's it.
this is a notre dame registrato poster correctly.
we can move from poster to physics of this environment.
the essential point is that we can do things with social environment. this is now taking data from all of us--from the entire collective memory of how earth looks, from visual perspective--and connecting all those data together.
all those pictures become connected together, greater than the sum of the parts.
you have a model of the whole earth that emerges.
think about this as the work of stephen lawler work on virtual earth.
it's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it, and whose advantages for those who use it increases with use.
their pictures are branded with metadata to other people.
if somebody comes to the idea of contrassee all of these santis by saying the name, my picture of notre dame's cathedral suddenly enrichs of all of that data, and i can use it as a point of entry to dive me in that space, in that metauniverse, using
of course, a consequence of all of this are extremely elaborate virtual models of all interesting earth, collected not just from aeree and satellite images and similar, but from collective memory.
thank you very much.
chris anderson: do i understand well? what your software will allow us to do is that at some point in the next few years, all the pictures shared by anyone in the world will be connected together?
baa: yeah. what he's doing is he's going to discover.
it's creating hyperslinks, if you want to, between pictures.
and he's doing it based on the content of images.
the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simple information that many of these pictures have.
as you do a search for images on the web, you type a sentence and the text on the web has a lot of information about the images of the picture.
now, what if that photograph is connected to all your pictures?
so the amount of interconnectedness is the amount of wealth that comes from it is really huge. it's a classic network effect.
ca: blaise, it's really amazing. compliments.
baa: thank you very much.
one of the main pleasures when you travel is one of theizis of etnographic research, and you can live between who hasn't forgotten the ancient traditions, including the past in the wind, touch it into the folding by the rain, the tastes in the love of
you just think that shamans travel even further beyond the milky way, or the myths of the elderly inuit are still meaningful, or that in himalayas, the buddhist still chasing the breath of dharma, to remind the central importance of anthropolo
the consequence of a particular adaptive choice set that our stirpe has done, good or bad, many generations ago.
and, of course, we all share the basic traits.
we're all born. we're all going to try.
we're subjective to initiation.
we need to deal with the inexhaustible of death, so we don't surprise if we can and dance--
we all have an art.
what's hitting is the particular rhythm of the song, the rate of dance of any culture.
it doesn't matter whether they're borneo forest's forest, or the bathrooms of the voodoo of haiti, or the warrior of the desert in northern kenya, the cure of the andes, or a camels in the sahara heart.
he was my journey companion in the desert a month ago, or a yak' svator in the qomolangma valley, everest, the mother of the world.
all of these populations teach us that there are other ways to exist other ways of thinking, other ways of moving around the world.
and, if you think about it, it's a concept that can give you hope.
together, cultures's miriads in the world create a spiritual and cultural web of life that turn the planet, and it's important for the well-being of the planet as biological ragnatela known as biosphere as biosphere.
and you can think of this cultural ragnatela as a etnosphere, and you can define etnosphere the full sum of all concepts, dreams, mits, ideas, inspired, inspirations, intuitions, intuitions, human imagination from the dawn of consciousness.
the etnosphere is the amazing human heritage.
it's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as an inquisitive species.
and because biosphere was very, very strongly consumed to etnosphere and unfortunately, much more quickly.
no biologists, for example, would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the brink of extinction just because it's false, or--in the most apocalyptic hypothesis--in the field of biological diversity--and it doesn't even approach the most op
the index of that is, of course, language loss.
when you were born, 6, 000 languages on this planet.
a language is not only about a dictionary or a series of grammatical rules.
a language is the sprazy of the human spirit.
it's the middle with which the anim of every culture comes into the material world.
every language is a forest of the mind, a basin, a thought, a spiritual ecosystem.
and of those 6, 000 languages, as we're sitting in monterey, at least half of them are no longer lonely in the ears of children.
they're no longer taught to children, which means, unless they change something, which are already dead.
what's more sad than being taken from silence, being the last to talk a language, of not having way to transmit the wisdom of the avi or to anticipate the promise of your children?
this hook fato is somebody's state in somewhere in the world every two weeks: every two weeks a elderly dies and carry it in grave the last syllabus of a ancient language.
" and i know some of you will say, " " isn't that better? "
" the world wouldn't be a better place if we all talk about language? " " okay, so let's talk about yoruba. let's talk about it. "
let's talk about kogi.
you'll find out of a sudden what it means not to talk to your language.
today i'd like to make you a journey through etnosphere--
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a taste of what we're losing.
" most of us forget that when i say" " different ways of exist" " i mean really different ways of exist. "
so let's take this kimbo barasana, in northern amazon, the anaconda people, who believe the myth to come from the east milk river in the bread of sacred snakes.
it's a people who are not able to distinguish the blue color from green because the time it's been identified in the forest, where the people depends on.
" they have a strange language and a matrimonial rule called" " linguistic esogamia" " : you have to marry a person talking a different language. "
all of this has rooted into the myth of my myth, though the particular thing is that in these extended families where you talk about six or seven languages because of the marriages had no language practice.
they're limited to listening and then start talking.
let's take one of the most interesting tribe that i've lived with, the waorani of the northeast ecuador nordorientale, an amazing people who had the first contatti in 1958.
in 1957, five missionaries, they tried a contact by edible a fatal mistake.
they made it down from the high photographs that would find them in pose that they thought they were friendly, forget that this people in the rainforest had never seen anything bi-dimensional.
they collected the pictures from the ground, and they've turned them to search for a shape or a figure, and, by finding nothing, they concluded that it was the devil, and they killed the five missionaries with the lances.
but waoranis didn't kill the strangers.
they kill themselves.
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves.
we went back to eight generations, and we found two cases of natural death, and when we insisted to know, they got older that one of them was aging so that he died aging, and then killed it. [laughter] anyway, they had an incredible knowledge of the forest.
hunter were able to recognize the animal urine animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
in the early' 80s, i was given a really interesting task when my harvard professor asked me if i wanted to go to haiti to intrufolaola my society to the basis of the duvalier power and the tuna, and impossessaing the poison used to make zombie.
to make sense of miraculous, i should have to understand the vodoun culture is that voodoo is not black magic.
it's about a complex metaphysical view of the world.
very interesting.
if i asked you to tell me the great religions in the world, what would you say?
christianity, islam, buddhism, ebraism, etc.
one continent is always left out, thinking that sub-saharan africa has no religious feds. and instead, the voodoo is nothing but the distilled of these very profound religious concepts were born during the diasporal of slavery.
what makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death.
so the vivi are born spirits.
spirits can be used by the big water, respond to the rate of dance and replace time to live soul so that for a short second, the followers becomes god.
" so the voodooiss love to say, " " white you go to church talking about god. "
" we dannd in the temple and become god. " " "
and since you're possessed, it's the spirit you drive, how can you hurt yourself?
so you're seeing these incredible events: you're voodoo in the state of trance that touches tizzoni impunis infuocated a pretty strong demonstration of the power of the body in the body when it's catalyzed in an extreme excitement state.
among all the people who lived the most extraordinary are sierra nevada de santa marta sierras in northern colombia.
the descendants of the ancient civilization that once lived in colombia's caribbean crying in waiting for conquista, the people would reckon on the volcanoing volcano that is erg to the caribbean crying.
in a continent of blood, this people has never been conquered by the spanish spanish.
they're now governed by a priest, but their training is quite extraordinary.
the young followers are brought away from families to three or four years, and they live secrets in a world of dark and shadows in stone capacity to the basis of glaciers for 18 years.
two nine-year-olds of nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turned into the mother's uterus, are now metaphorically in the uterus of the great mother.
for all of this time, they're embraced to the values of their society, values that predict their prayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance--or to better say ecological balance.
at the end of this amazing start, they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, when they're 18, they see a dawn. and in that moment of consciousness of the first toilet, when the sun kissing the beautiful landscapes, all they have learned in theory
" " " see? just like i said. "
" it's wonderful. now it's protecting it. " " "
it's called the biggest brothers, and they say that we, minori brothers, are the guilty of the world's destruction.
this level of intuition is extremely important.
when we think about indigenous populations and the environment we invoke rousseau is the old story of the wild noble, which is a racism in its simplicity or maybe invokes thoreau and say that these peoples are closer to the earth of us.
indigenous peoples are not sentimental nor indebolites from nostalgia.
there's no space for these things in the asmat's sick, or the venti gelidi of tibet, but because of time and rhythms, they created a mystery of the earth based on the concept of being aware of it, but on a more subtle intuition: the concept that earth
what does that mean?
it means that a kid of the andes growing up believing that the mountain is a open spirit that will guide his fate is going to be a profoundly different human being, and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place compared to a montana kid that grows to believe that a mountain
whether it's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cava and irrelevant.
what's interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
i grew up in the forest of british columbia believing that the forests needed to be cut.
this made me a different human being from my kwakiutl friends who believe that forests are the dimora of hukuk and the drink of paradise and the cannibali spirits that live in the north extremity of the world, spirits who face during the hamatsa start.
if you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality, you can start understanding some of their sensational findings. let's take this plant.
i took this picture to april in the nordoccidentale amazon.
perhaps some of you have heard about the ayahuasc, the most powerful psychoactive substance of the shamanic repertoire.
what makes the ayahuasca is not the drug potential of the substance, but its processing. it's come from two elements.
on the one hand, this liana wood that contains a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harmoline, slightly high hallucinogene.
and by taking the only plant, you have a blue smoke that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's mixed with the leaves of an arbust of the coffee family said a viridis psychotria.
this plant contains powerful triptamine, very similar to serotonin, to avoidptamine-5, methoxydimethyltryptamine.
if you ever see yanomami pulls up the nose, the substance they do from a different set of species, they also have methoxydimethyltryptamine.
pulling that powder on the nose and a little bit like being shot by a rifle of barocchi paintings and land on a electricity tide sea. [laughter] doesn't create a reality disorder; it creates reality dissotion.
i often talk to my professor, richard evan shultes, the man who raised the psychiatrists, with his discovery of mushroom mushrooms in the 1930s in mexico.
according to my thesis, you can't rank these triptamine as a hallucination because if you're done, you can't tell anybody you're burning. [laughter] the triptamin can't be thrown orally because they're held by an enzyme that is naturally
it's possible to hire them orally if you assign with other chemicals that make maos.
now it's nice: the beta-carboline that's in this liana are inhibitors of mao, the same kind of necessary to get rid of triples. the question is spontaneous: in a flora of 80, 000 plants, as these peoples are doing two mor
we use the great euphemism of evidence and mistake, which can reveal infruttifer.
" but if we ask indians, they'll say" " plants talk to us. " " "
what does that mean?
this tribe, cofan, has 17 diversity of ayahuasca, who dislikely in the forest, is that our eyes would come back into the same species.
" if we ask him how their tassonomy will tell us, " " i thought about plants, do you know everything? " " i said" " no. " " "
the solution is: you take 17 varieties in a night of moon, full moons and everybody can raises with a different tone.
with that, you don't graduate in harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting stami.
now, [applause] the problem is that even those of us who care about indigenous peoples are getting pittoreschis, but somehow reduced the margins of history than our real world, and move beyond.
in fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, it's not going to be reminded for the wars or the technological innovation, but rather like the age where we stopped and embraced or accepting the mass destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet. now the problem isn' t
all cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
and the problem is not technology.
the sioux indians don't stop being sioux when they put aside and arrows like americans don't stop being americans when they put on the horse and quit.
it's not change or technology that threaten the integrity of etnosphere. it's power.
the dominance face.
and if you look at a look at the world, you'll find that these are not cultures that are going to disappear.
they're living and dynamic creatures out of the existence of identified forces that go beyond their ability to adapt.

if we move on the mountains of tibet, where i'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the hard face of political dominaation.
as you know the genocide, the physical extinction of a people, it's convicted universal, but etnocidio, the destruction of the lifestyle of a people's lifestyle, not only is not convicted, but even celebrating in certain environments, because it's part of development strategy.
and you can't understand the suffering of tibet until you start from the beginning.
i took the 6, 000 miles from chengdu in west china through the south elderly tibet, coming to lhasa with a young colleague, but only arrived in lhasa i realized what's behind the statistics we hear about.
6, 000 sacred bags get in dust and cenere.

her mother was imprited, and his fault was rich.
it was taken hidden in jail at the age of two-year-old hiding under his skirt because he could not live without him.
the sister, who did the same, was put in the camp camp.
one day, he inadequately calculated a mushroom mao and, for this transgression, he was put in the work for seven years.
the pain of tibet can be insopportable, but the redemption spirit of the people is to keep present.
at the end of the day, everything is reduced to a choice.
do we want to live in the monochlear world or want to embrace the polymer world of diversity?

that shark story doesn't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we're going to face in millennia to come.
when these miriads of cultures in the world are asked what it means to be human, they respond to 10, 000 different voices.
and it's in these answers that we all find the possibility of being what we are: a kind of conscious species, that has to make all the peoples and all gardens can blame. and there are great moments of optimism.
i took this picture on the northern extremity of baffin island, when i went to whale whale whales, and this man, olaya, told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
the canadian government wasn't always nice to the inuit people and in the 1950s to stabilire our supremacinth, we locked them into colonies.
the grandfather of this man refused to go.
the family, feared for his life, took him all the weapons, and all of his tools.
you have to know that inuit don't afford the cold, use it.
the sledges in als were made of fish adjusted in caribu skin.

he shakeed the dog and created a bad one, with the cassa toracic created a sledge, he's set up another dog, and he's disappeared on the hearing, knocking knife in the stay.
do we want to talk about getting away with nothing? [laughter] is this, in different ways, [applause] is the symbol of resilience of the inuit people and all indigenous peoples in the world.
in april 1999, the canadian government reduced the total control of a larger area of california and texas put together.
it's their new home. it's called nunavut.
it's a independent territory. they control all the mining resources.
a wonderful example of how a nation-state can reconcile with his people.
and finally, i think it's pretty obvious at least who we've been in these remote areas of the planet, realizing that they're not remote at all.
someone's home.
they represent human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. and for us all, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the geography cloud of hope.

thank you.
i'm going to talk about some things that i wrote in this book that i hope you're going to call others that you've already heard and try to highlight some links, in case you don't see them.
" i want to start with what i call" " the official dogma. " " "
the official dogma of what?
" the official dogma of all western industrial societies, the official officer, " " if we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens" " " " the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. " " "
the reason is, on the one hand, the fact that freedom is in itself as valuable, is valuable, useful, essential for humans.
on the other hand, if we're free, every one of us can act for realizing everything that's massive our well-being, without anybody else deciding in our own.
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.
the more choices people have, the more free, the more freedom is their freedom, greater and their well-being.
this, i think, is so deeply rooted in society that no one would dream to question it.
and it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
i'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
this is my supermarket. it's not particularly big.
i'm afraid of a simple note on the condiment to put together.
in my supermarket, there are 175-dimensional, without counting the 10 different extraverge oil of olive oil and the 12 whales that you can buy in order to make you an enormous number of training in the increiterate circumstances that no one of the 175 already ready to be about your
that's how supermarket is.
then you go to the electronics store to buy a stereo: casse, cd readers, radio, plate, amplifier.
and in this single electronics store, there's a big number of audio components.
we can make six and a half million combinations of different combinations using the components that are in one store.
you have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
other fields: the communications world.
once, when i was a kid, you could get all the phone service, and you could get the telephone services, in the pathte that were providing by mom bell.
you wouldn't buy the phone, you didn't buy it.
one consequence of that, by the way, was that the phone never break.
these days went.
now we've got a variety of mobile phones, especially in mobile phones.
here's the cell phones of the future.
my favorite is the one in between, readers mp3, cut noses of the nose, and they're for the creme brulee.
if you haven't seen it yet in the shop under the house, you're well sure that sooner will come.
" and what's happening is that people enter the shops and makes this question, and you know what the answer is? the answer is" " no. " " "
you can't buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
so in other aspects of life that are much more important than buying, the same explosion of choice.
healthcare: it doesn't happen anymore in the united states that you go from the doctor and the doctor tell you what you have to do.
" instead, go to the doctor, and the doctor says, " " okay, we could do a, or b" " " " " to have these benefits and these risks, " " b has these benefits and these risks. what do you want to do? " " "
" you say, " " doctor, what should i do? " " "
" and the doctor says, " " it has these benefits and these risks, and b has these benefits and these risks. " " "
" " " what do you want to do? " " "
" and i said, " " doctor if she was me, what would you do? " " "
" and the doctor: " " but i'm not her. " " "
" we call it" " sick autonomy, " " expression that makes it look nice. "
but it's actually not that a shifting weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, which is the doctor, to someone else who doesn't know anything--it's almost certainly sick--and so not in ideal condition to make decisions that's patient.
there's an enormous marketing of pharmaceutical products, to direct people like me and you, that if you think about it has no sense, since we can't buy it.
but if we can't buy them, why do we advertise them?
the answer is that they want to call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe.
" something so fundamental as our identity is now a matter of choice, as we see in this cartoon, " " we don't want to force children. they will choose their sex at the right time, " " we don't inherited identity anymore: we need to invent it. "
and we can reinvent how many times aggrades us.
which means that every morning, every morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
compared to the family and marriage, a time the common perspective, almost for anyone, was that you were married as soon as possible, and you started kids as soon as possible.
the only real choice was with who, not when, is not what to do next.
today, everything is really to play.
i teach students very smart, and i give them 20 percent less work than at a time.
and not because they're less brilliant, not because they're less diligent.
" but why are they imitated, intent to ask yourself, " " should i marry or not? should i do it now? " " "
" " " should i marry later? should i think about children or career? " " "
they're interrogatives logorantis.
and they're trying to answer these questions, even though that means not to complete tasks that check and don't get a good vote to my test.
and they really need to do it. they're important questions.
now, the work: we're lucky, as carl underline, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, except from the hotel randolph.
by the way, there's a corner, and i'm not going to tell anyone which, where wifi works.
i don't tell you, because i want to use it.
what does that mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? is that we have to decide, all at the time, if we have to work or not.
we can go and see our son play calcium, with mobile phone in a pocket, blackberry in the other, and the notebook, typically, the knees.
" and even though they're all off, every minute we see our son ruin the game, we're also asking, " " do i have to answer this call? " " "
" " " do i have to answer this email? do i have to match this letter? " " "
" and even when the answer is" " no, " " that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions. "
so from anywhere we look at, small and big things, materials and styles of life, life is a matter of choice.
once the world was this: that was, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all about choice.
" today's world looks like this: dilemma is, " " is it positive, or negative? " " "
the answer is yes.
we all know them all know, so i'm going to talk about negative ones.
all this choice is going to be two negative effects on people.
the first, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis rather than freezing.
with many options where they choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
i'm going to give you a significant example: a study led to volunteers volunteers.
one of my colleague has had access to the vanguard data, the giant retirement funds company, with about a million employees in 2, 000 companies.
what she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered more, the percentage of two percent fires.
with 50 fundraisers, there's 10 percent less than a sticker than when they're just five. why?
because with 50 funds where they choose, it's pretty coolly difficult to decide, and choice is sent back to indomani.
and tomorrow, and tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes.
you know that it doesn't mean just that these old workers will eat food for dogs because they won't have enough money, they also want to say that the decision is so hostile that they lose the complementary funding of labor employer.
not participating, they're losing to 5, 000 dollars per year from employer, which would be well willing to pour them.
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
and i think it makes the world like this.
" " " and to finish, for eternity: ketchup, senape or maionese? " " "
you'd like to take the right decision, if it's for eternity, right?
you don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and even the wrong dimensional.
so this is the first effect. the second is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, we are less satisfied by the outcome of how we would have been with less options where they choose.
and that's for different reasons.
one of them is that with many of them that i choose to choose, if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better. and what's happening is that the alternative imagined us to regret the choice
even when it was a good decision.
the more choices there are, the more easy to mind than any detail that is insoddisfacent of choice option.
also, there's what economists call cost-opportunity.
dan gilbert clearly has been very good at this as the value that we take to things depends on what we compare.
the rest of that, when there are lots of options that are possible, it's easy to represent the attractive features of alternative waste and be less satisfied than the option that's chosen.
here's an example. i apologize with all those who are not new york.
but that's what you probably would probably think.
there's this couple to hamptons.
a place of luxury.
it's beautiful. good day. it's all for them.
" nothing wrong. but what he thinks is, " " well, curse, it's august. " " "
" " " all my neighbors in manhattan are away. " " "
" " " i could park right at home. " " "
and he passes two weeks that's taken from the idea that's losing--every day--the possibility of parking where he wants.
the cost-opportunity will decrease the satisfaction for what we have, even when choice was excellent.
and the more the options that we have to consider, the more attraeli features will come back as expensive-opportunity.
here's another example.
this cartoon tells us a lot of things.
it's about living right now, and perhaps the live live.
but the most important thing is, whatever you choose, you choose not to do other people.
the things that we don't choose have a lot of attachment that can make less attractive what we do.
third point: growing expectations.
i tried it on my skin by buying a new pair of jeans.
she took almost always jeans.
once jeans were just one kind of, buying them and dressed them, they were disappearing, only after they brought them a life and washed a lot of times, they started going well.
" so i went to buy a couple of new when the old ones had gone, and i said, " " i need a couple of jeans, this is my size. " " "
" the comfort said to me, " " do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? " " "
" do you want them to give them a circle or with the buttons? " " stonewashed" " or" " acidwashed? " " "
" " " do you want to tear them? " " "
" " " under them wants larghi or stretti? blah blah blah. . . " " he kept coming. "
" and i was amazed, and after a while i was saying, " " i want the guy who--that was the only guy. " " he had no idea what it was, so for an hour, i tried all of my evil jeans, and then came out of the store,
it was the most. with all that choice i had gotten the best.
but i felt worse.
why? i wrote a whole book to understand it.
the reason i was worse is that with all of that choice, my expectations were high, jeans had to be perfect.
at first i had expectations. i wasn't expecting anything remarkable when there was only one guy, but when i saw 100 different, i explained, at least one type had to be perfect.
what i had bought was good, but not perfect.
after i compare that chosen with what i was looking for in comparison to expectations.
the addition of options in people's lives does not increase the expectations that these have compared to the excellence of options themselves.
and this will produce less satisfaction, even when the results are good.
nobody in marketing realizing it.
because if they knew, you wouldn't know what i'm talking about.
the truth looks more like this.
" " " you were better when you were worse, " " the reason you were better when you were worse and that when you were worse was still possible to meet enjoyable surprises. "
today, in the world that we live in-opulent, industrialized citizens with perfection expectancy--the most that we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations.
you're never going to have pleasant surprised because your expectations, my expectations, they've replaced.
" the secret of happiness--what you're here--is, " " low expectations" " " " yes, you want it. " " "
i mean--small autobiographical moment--who are really married and my wife is really beautiful.
i couldn't do better, i didn't know.
but it's not always bad. it's always bad.
" finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans disappear when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfied, and you ask yourself, " " why? " " "
" " " who is responsible? " " the answer is clear. "
the world is responsible. what could i do?
when you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a dissatisfied, and you ask yourself who is responsible, and just as clear as the responsible you are.
you could do better.
with hundreds of variety available, there are no excuses for the halluccesso.
so when people make decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel dissatisfied and give their fault.
over the last few years, depression is exploded in industrialized world.
i think a significant factor--not the only one, but important--of this wave of depression is just that people have disappointed experiences because standards are too high.
and when they have to explain this situation, they think the fault is them.
so the final result is that we're better, objectively, but we feel worse.
let me remind you.
this is the official dogma, what we all take good for good, and it's completely false. it's not true.
there's no question that a little bit of choice is better than not having it at all, but it doesn't come out that a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
there's critical value, magical. i don't know what it is.
but i'm pretty sure that we've run from a piece the level where choices improve our lives.
now, from the political point of view--i almost finished--from the political point of view, the baby and the following.
what all this choice in industrial society is material wealth.
there's a lot of places in the world, and you know a lot of it, where the problem is not that they have too much choice.
the problem is they have too little.
so the faccending i'm talking about is a malaysicist exclusive of modern, western wealth.
and what makes it depressing and angry is this: steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how much those expensive and disappear for girls are worthless. it's a waste of money.
i mean that these choices, complicated and dispending, it's not just useless.
they're even deleteries.
they're getting worse.
if a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choices were available in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not only be their life to improve but ours.
this is what economists call a walls walls.
a income redesign is good for all--not just the poor--because of this excitement choice that we're touched.
" so to conclude, " " son, you can become everything you want. " " "
" you, people of culture, you think, " " what do you believe that fish? " " "
" " " it's obvious that you can't do anything in a glass stick. " " "
" " " castlar imagination, a limited view of the world--" " "
and i said that way, at the beginning.
but then, when you think about it, instead, i realized that that fish is long.
" because the reality of the facts is that if you send your mouth, so that" " everything is possible, " " you don't get freedom. you get paralysis. "
if you break the stick so that everything is possible to decrease the satisfaction.
accentuate paralysis, and reduce the well-being.
everybody needs a sphere.
this is almost certainly too tight, perhaps even fish, and certainly for us.
but the absence of some spheres is a recipe for unhappiness and, i'm afraid, for rock.
thank you very much.
