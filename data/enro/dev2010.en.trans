last year i showed these two slides to prove that the whole polar way that in the vast majority of the last three million years has been the size of 48 low-size size size, it was 40 percent.
but this diminished seriousness of this special problem because it doesn't look like ice thickness.
the polar swimmer is, in a way, the heart beating the global climate system.
she expands the winter and contracting the summer.
the next slide i'm going to show you is a quick view of what happened over the last 25 years.
the peanut ice is tagged with red.
as you can see it expands to the dark blue.
this is the annual ice over the winter.
and they diminishing summer.
this is what the permanent ice called, a five-year-old or more, you can see it's almost like blood improbable from a body.
in 25 years it came from this, this one.
this is a problem because warming causes the mess of the earth around the ocean of artictic.
where there's a massive carbon amount of carbon that, when it's messy, it's turned into methane by micro-organisms.
compared to total pollution because global warming in the atmosphere could double if we move this point of extreme.
already in some bit deep lakes in alaska, metanul was actually sick in the surface of water.
professor katey walter at university of alaska was on the field with another team to another lake a little deep deep last winter.
video: wow! al gore: she's okay. the question is if we're going to be.
" and one reason is that this enormous" " blind" " hot hot heat heating north. "
this is a river that's melting every year.
but volumes are much larger than ever.
this is kangerlussuaq river in southern greenland.
if you want to know how the sea level is growing from the melting melting on the dry table, this is where it ends up.
these debite grow very rapidly.
and on the other end of the plant, antarctica of the largest ice table on the planet.
last month, scientists reported that the entire ice continent continent is negative and west antarctica on the top of submarines are melting fast.
this is equal to seven feet above sea level, just like greenland.
in himalayas, the third ice table, on the top you see new lakes, which was a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population is getting half the drinking water from these top stories.
in the year, this glaciers is drinking water source for this city.
debitele grew up.
but when it comes away, this is how it happens with drinking water.
in california, there was a 40 percent decrease in the snow layer in sierra.
this affects water reserves.
and predictions, as you read, they're serious.
throughout the globe, the uscaciunea led to dramatic growth of fires.
and disasters came along the whole globe grew up with an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate.
four times more in the last 30 years to the 75 years.
this is an undesirable model.
if you look in historic context you can see what's going on.
over the past five years, i added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours 25 million tons every day in the oceans.
look at the recipe of the pacific area of america, going to the west, and every part of the indian subcontinent where it's a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean.
the biggest cause of global warming by deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is burning fossil fuels.
oil is a problem and coal is the most serious.
the united states is one of the two great emitters, with china.
and the proposal was to build more factories for coal.
but we're starting to see a total change.
here are the people who have gone over the last few years with ecological alternatives proposed.
however, there's a political struggle in our country.
and the carbonifera industry and oil industry spent a quarter billion dollars in the last year of calendaristic.
promoting clean coal that's anximoron.
this image reminds me of something.
in the christmas, at me in tennessee, a billion carbunep gallons was spreading.
you've probably seen the news.
this is all over the country, the second big spark in america happened in the christmas.
one of the ads of the coal industry, pretty much around christmas days, was this.
video: frosy, the coal man, is a happy and happy soul.
he's from abundance here in america, and he's helping economic growth.
frosty, the coal man, becomes a day that goes cleaner.
he's accessible and adorable and workers keep their jobs.
al gore: this is the source of major crazy carbunvity in west virginia.
the highest pile of coal is the boss of massey coal.
video: don blankenship: i want to be clear. al gore, nanci pelosi, harry reid reid haven't really got what i'm talking about.
al gore: so the alliance for climate protection launched two campaigns.
this is one of them, part of one of them.
actor: by coalergy, we see climate change as a very serious threat to our business.
that's why our main goal is to spend a great amount of money for advertising efforts to help us show and complify the truth about coal.
the truth is that, in fact, coal is not dirty.
we think it's clean--and smells and good.
so it won't worry about climate change.
let's leave that tonight.
actor: clean coal, you've heard a lot about it.
and so let's do a tour of this masterpiece of coal installation.
amazing! the machine is kind of noisy.
but this is the sound of the clean coal technology.
and while coal ars is one of the main causes of global warming technology technology that you see here is changing everything.
look closely, this is today's technology of clean coal.
al gore: the end of positive alternative fits with economic challenge and the problem of national security.
narrator: narrator: america is in crisis, economics, national security, climate crisis.
the threat that connects all of them, the noasta dependence on carbon fuel: dirty coal and foreign oil.
but now we have a new bold solution to get out of the mess.
re-energized america with 100 percent clean electricity in 10 years before.
a plan to put america back to work, it makes us safer and to help stop global warming.
finally, a solution that is enough to help us solve our problems.
re-energized america. you know.
al gore: this is the last one.
narrator: narrator: it's about re-energization of america.
one of the fastest ways to remove the addiction of old dirty fuels that kill our planet man: the future is here. wind, sun, a new energy network.
barbat nr. 2: we investment to create well-paid jobs.
narrator: re-energized america. it's time for action.
" al gore: there's an old african proverb that says, " " if you want to go fast, go alone. " " "
if you want to get away, you go.
we have to get away, quickly.
thank you very much.
last year at ted i did a introduction at lhc.
and i promised to come back and give you a update about how this machine works.
so here i am. and for those of you who weren't here, lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that's ever been trying--27 kilometers of purpose or is to recreate the conditions at less than a billion-second fraction of creating the universe--up to 600 billion times
it's extremely ambitious.
this is the device under the city of geneva.
" we're taking pictures of these" " big bangs" " inside dectotics. "
i work on this. it's called the atlas detector--length of 44 meters, a spectacular photograph here of the atlas detector in construction to see the proportion.
last september last year, i started the camera for the first time.
and this image was taken by atlas.
he caused a huge celebration in the control room.
it's a picture of the first fascinated particle that traveled throughout the lhc system, putting it with some of the lhc deliberate, throwing particles in detector.
in other words, when i saw that image on september, i knew that the camera worked, which is a huge success.
i don't know if that got the largest ovatii, or this, when someone went on the google page and saw that the first page looks like this.
it means i did a cultural impact on the scientific impact.
after about a week, i had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these wires--these gold wires.
those wires transport 13 thousand america when the machine works at the maximum power.
" now, the engineers in the room are looking at these wires and say, " " i can't transport so many america. i'm small wires. " " "
but i can do that because when they're at low temperature, they become what's called superconducts.
so, in about degrees, being more cold than the space between stars, those wires can transport these kinds of currents.
at one of the links between the over 9000 of magnets in lhc, it was a manufacturing definition.
and so the wire got warmed a little bit, and those 13 thousands of experiences met electrical resistance.
this was the result.
this is more impressive that those magnets weighed over 20 tons, and it's almost 30 inches.
so, i deteriorate about 50 magnets.
we had to get them out, which i did.
i reconditioned everybody, repair them.
and now we take magnets back underground.
by the end of march the lhc machine will be like again again.
we're going to start it again, and we expect it to get data in june or july, and we're going to continue the research to find out what the essential elements of the universe are.
now, of course, in a sense, those redesigning accidents about the importance of science and engineering led to extreme. it's easy to breathe.
i think it's because it's so difficult because we have high targets, this is the importance of experiments like lhc.
" i'm going to leave you to close the words of a british scientist, humphrey davy, who, i think, when the useless experiments of protecting or, this is michael faraday, said, " " nothing is more dangerous for human progress than we should assume that our mind
thank you.
i'd like to start with the rugaminte to remember a childhood when you're playing with cubes.
as you've learned to put them together and raise them and move them around, you've actually learned how to think and solve problems understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
the perception of space is deeply linked to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
so, as a researcher inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects--along with my square consultant, and my collaborator of jeevan kalanithi--i started to wonder--what if we use a computer, instead of this unique mouse, instead of a digital fingerprint moving moving
by showing it how we want it?
this question was so fascinating that we decided to research the answer to build andftables.
in short, a siftable is an interactive computer by the size of a biscuite.
they can be easy, they can perceive each other, they can perceive each other, and they have a screen and a wireless radio.
the most important one is that they're palpable, so like play cubes, you can just move them.
and andftables offers an example of a new ecosystem of manipulation of digital information.
as these tools become more palpable, more aware of their movement, the conscience of each other, and the consciousness of the nuance of our actions on them, we can start to explore new styles and fun to interact.
i'm going to start with a few simple examples.
and this andftable is configured to present video images, and if you decline it into a direction, it's running it like this, if you decline it in the other side, it's running back.
these interactive portraits are aware of each other.
so if i put them next to each other, they become interested.
if they're surrounded, they'll notice that, and they can become a bit confused.
they can also feel the movement and the decline.
we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction is that we could use ordinary gestures to manipulate the data, like to turn a color like a liquid.
in this case, we have three andftables configured as paint gallerys and can use them to torn color in the center where they're going to mix.
if we get too much, we can turn a little bit back.
there's also interesting possibilities for education, such as language games, mathematical games and logics that we want to give people the possibility of trying fast, and see the results immediately.
so here i have--this is a fibonacci sir that i do with a simple equation program.
here's a word game of words, sort of combination between scrabble and boggle.
basically, in every tour, you get a letter on every andftable, and as you try to form words, they're verified with a dictionary.
then, after about 30 seconds, the letters are resources, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities of trying.
thank you.
these are some kids who came to the media lab, and i managed to convince them to try and film a material.
he loved it.
and one of the interesting things about this kind of app is that you don't have to give people a lot of instructions.
" all you have to say is" " do words, " " and they know exactly what to do. "
here are some other people trying to try.
this is our youngest beta tests down on the right.
it turns out that all he wanted to do was put in andftables one over another.
so for him they were just cubes.
this is an interactive animation application.
we wanted to build a tool for people learning languages.
and this is felix.
he can introduce new characters in the stage, just by raising those andftables that had taken the characters.
here's the sun.
video: sunrise.
david merrill: now he introduced a tractor in stage.
video: orange tractor.
very good! yeah!
moving andftables and sitting next to each other, he can make the characters interact--video: ham!
dm: creating their own narrative.
video: hi!
dm: it's an open story, and he's going to decide how it's going to go.
video: fly, pisico!
dm: the last example i have time to show you today is a live-performing tool that we've developed recently, and in whichftables have the role of sound as rhythm, bas and tobe.
each of these has four different variations, you choose to use.
and you can inject the sounds in a success that you can assemble after printing you want.
you put the sounds touches and the sound of sound by a successry.
there's the effects you can control live, like reverberation and filter.
you attach it to a certain sound, and then you decline it to help it.
it's the general effects like the temporary and volume that are applied to the whole sequences, let's see.
dm: we're going to start with a pace in two andftables de succession, we're showing them in a series, we expand it, we're more adjusting the pace.
now i put a line of bas.
video: dm: now i'm adding a little bit of fun.
dm: and now i'm going to add the filter tobe, to control live effect.
dm: i can grabi the whole sequence inclineing the temporary one or another.
dm: now i'm going to attach the bas filter for more expression.
dm: i can reject the sequence while playing.
so i don't have to make the plan in the prealably, i can improvise, by the way, by shortcuting the song in walking.
now, finally, i can push the whole sequence using the volume of volume, inclined on the left.
thank you.
as you can see, my passion is creating new human-computer interface that fit better with the way our brains work.
and today, i had time to show you a coordinate of this new design space, and some of the possibilities that we're trying to take out of the lab.
the thought that i'd like to remember is that we're at the border with this new generation of digital tools with digital means that will bring information into our world after our rules.
thank you very much.
i expect you to talk to you all.
they're writing.
writing books is my profession, but it is, of course, more than that.
it's also my great love and fascination of life.
and i don't expect this to ever change.
but that said, something kind of weird happened recently in my life and my career, which made me recalibrate my entire relationship with work.
" and the strange thing is that i recently wrote this book recently, this autobiography called" " eat, pray, love, " " which, as opposed to any of my previous books, came out in the world for some reason, and became this important, mega-sensational best seller international
the result is that everywhere i go now, people treat me as if i was convictedd.
seriously-condamnata, convicted!
" i come from worrying and i say, " " don't you fear--you're never afraid that you'll never be able to overcome this performance? "
" you're not afraid that you're going to continue to write your whole life without ever creating a book that would ever care about someone in this world ever? " " "
it's very quiet, indeed.
but it was even worse if i didn't remember anything that i was 20 years ago, when i started to witnessing people--when i was a teenager--that i want to become a writer, i hit the same kind of reaction based on a kind of fear.
" and people would say, " " isn't you afraid you would never have any successful? " " "
don't you just fall as humiliation of rejection will kill you?
" isn't it afraid that you're going to work your entire life in this domain, and nothing will never come out of here and die on a bunch of dreams endless dream of essence? " " "
something like that.
" the answer--the short answer to all those questions is" " yes. " " "
yeah, it's afraid of all those things.
and i've always been.
and i'm afraid of still more other things that people can't even get into.
like marine algae, and other things that are scary.
" but when it's about writing that i've been thinking about, and i've been asking about the last time is, " " why? " " "
is it rational?
it makes sense that anyone to wait for them to be afraid of work that they feel that they were destined to do this earth.
and what's so specific to creative initiatives that seems to really nervous about our own mental health in a way that other professions don't do it?
my father, for example, was an chemist engineer, and i don't remember that in his 40 years of chemical engineering to ask him somebody if it's not afraid to be a chemist engineer.
hasn't it happened--john, how does it work with the chemical engineering?
it just doesn't happen like that.
but to be honest, the chemist engineers that group didn't really have too much for centuries of reputation for depression.
new writers, we kind of have this reputation, and not just writers, but artists of all kinds, it turns out that they have this reputation to be strong mentally.
and all we have to do is look at the number of deaths that are recorded only in the 20th century, in the magnificent minds of creative, who died of young people and often.
and even those that didn't really have suicided to be really destroyed by their own talents.
" norman mailer, just before i die, in the last interview, said, " " each of my books killed me a little bit more. " " "
an extraordinary marturisire about your work of life.
but we don't even know when we hear somebody talking about this because we heard these kinds of things so many times, and we've kind of absorbed and completely accepted, at collective level, the idea that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently related and that art, eventually, will always lead
and the question i want to ask for you today is: are you all impatient with this idea?
you're comfortable with it--because as you can see it with the naked eye--i don't really rely on this hypothesis at all.
i think it's odious.
and i also think it's dangerous, and i don't want to see it perpetuatted in the future century.
i think it's better if we encourage our great artists to live.
and i certainly know that in my case--in my situation--it would be very dangerous to me to start to go to the darkness of this hypothesis, particularly because of the circumstances i'm currently in my professional.
for example, i'm kind of young, i've just about 40 years.
i've probably probably got four decades before.
and it's very likely that all i'm going to write with this moment to be judged by humanity as the work that came after my last books, right?
what i'd like to say it without menability, because in some sense we're already friends--it's very likely that my biggest success has already happened.
oh, my god, what i'm thinking!
this is the kind of thought that could make somebody start gin at nine in the morning, and i don't want to get that person.
i prefer to do this job that i love.
and then, the question becomes: how?
and so it seems to me, after a lot of meditation, that the way i have to work right now, to continue to write, is by creating a kind of protective psychological construction, right?
i must, in a way, find a way to keep a safe distance, between me, who write, and my absolute fear that i'm going to be about before the reaction to what i write.
and as i looked for the last year, i started looking for over time, and i tried to find other societies to see if it could have better and healthier ideas about how to help creative people manage the emotional risk of art.
this research led me to greece and ancient rome.
so watch me, because the circle shut down.
but, in ancient greek and ancient greeks, there were people who didn't think creativity came from the inside of man, ok?
people thought creativity was a very helpful spirit that's all about people from a remote and uncanned source, for foreign and uninteles.
" the greeks called these divine spirits of creativity with the famous term" " demoni. " " "
socrate was famous because he thought he was a demon that transmit his wisdom from the distance.
the romanii had the same view, but they called that creative spirit, the imaterial, genius.
what's great, because romanii didn't really believe that a genius was a particularly smart individual.
they thought that a genius was a kind of magica divina entity, which was literally living between the walls of the artist's studio, in a way that dobby, the spiridus of the house, who was doing their defense and insesisisbly asista artist in his work, shaped the result
absolutely bright--this is, this is the distance that i was talking about--that psychological construction to protect you from the outcome of your work.
and everyone knew that it worked, right?
so the ancient artist was protected by certain things, like for example, too much narcissism, right?
if your work was bright, you couldn't take your worthy for it, everyone knew you had this genius without a body that helped you.
if your work was criticized, it wasn't all your fault, isn't it?
everyone knew that your genius was kind of ignored.
this is how people looked at creativity for a long period of time.
and then the renaissance came, and everything changed with a great idea, the great idea of being able to put the man as individuals in the center of the universe above all of the gods and mysteries, without staying the place for mistic creatures that get the order from the divin.
it was the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came from within the individual.
and for the first time in history, people started to go to one or another of artists as brilliant, instead of having a genius.
and i have to witness you, i think there's a huge error.
allowing somebody, a simple person to believe that or she is actually the receptaculul, that it's actually the muscle and the essence and the source of the whole etern mystery, creative, creative, nepatruns is a little too much responsibility to the fragile psychiatric ps
it's like asking someone to freak the sun.
and it's just infected and it deformeizes the ego, and it generates all these heart expectation on the figure of performance.
i think that pressure has killed our artists after the last 500 years.
and if it's true, and i think it' s, the question is, what do we do now?
can we do things differently?
maybe we can go back to the older meaning of the relationship between humans and mystery of creativity.
maybe not.
maybe we can't just delete 500 years of rational humanitarian thinking through a 18-minute talk.
and it's probably people in the audience who would raise the absolutely legitimate question on the theme, zanelor actually, who are looking for people to press smiley sugar over their projects and so on.
i'm not going to take you all this idea.
but the question i want to ask is--why not?
why don't we think about this?
because it makes sense as much as anything else we've heard about explaining the capricioity completely crazy of the creative process.
the process that anybody ever tried to create something--basically all of the people here--knows that they don't always behave rational.
and in fact, sometimes it may seem to seem to the paranormal right.
i recently had a meeting where i met the extraordinary american ruth stone poeta, who now has about 90 years ago, and that was the whole life of told me that when my childhood in virginia was going to work on the field, and simply simulating a poem coming towards the field.
the story that it was like a storm of air.
and it's determined to it over fields.
he's feeling it coming, because he's flying the earth underneath his feet.
" at that point, he knew he had one thing to do, and that is, i quote, " " let's run like grabs. " " "
and it was running out to the house of the poem, and the whole idea was to get to a piece of paper and a pencil enough, because when it comes through it duduind, catch it and put it on paper.
" sometimes it wasn't fast enough, so running and running, but it doesn't get into the house and the poem rolls through it and she loses it, and the poem continues over the fields, looking for, i'm reading it" " another poet. " " "
there were moments where--and this part i'll never forget--moments in which the story almost lost it.
running home, he's looking for paper, and the poem goes through and grab the pencil exactly when he was preparing to get out, and the story that he's going on with him with his other hand and catch him.
they catch up the tail poem and pull it back into the body as they transcrite it on paper.
in such situations, the poem appears on perfect and intact, but to swell, from the last one to the first word.
when i heard it--it's supernatural, it was exactly how my own creative process works.
my creative process doesn't work on this--i'm not a pipeline!
i'm a catar, and the way i work i'm supposed to wake up every day at the same hour and transpir and sweat and shouting me and shouting me with weight.
but even me, in my passion, even i was touched sometimes by that phenomenon.
and i imagine that the same is also many of you.
even i had projects or ideas that came from a source that frankly didn't know how to identity.
and what does that mean?
and how does it assume that we should report to it so that we don't lose our minds, but, in fact, to help us remain healthy?
for me, the most relevant example of our day, which i have about how you can do is tom waits' musician, which i took a interview a few years ago at the demand of magazine.
i was talking about this subject, and tom was almost all his whole life to embodied the modern chinuit contemporary artist, trying to control, to manage and to dominate these creative chinese flashes completely interiorized.
with time, it's gone wrong, and i tell my story that one day leads to the highway to los angeles, and it all changed.
while he was running, suddenly he hears a short piece of a piece of evasive mind and amagitor, as often happens with inspiration and wants it, it's splendinda, it's not how to push it.
it has no sheet of paper, it has no pencil, no reportofon.
" he starts to feel all that old anxiety growing inside, " " i'll lose the moment, and this song's going to make me money forever. "
" i'm not good enough, no i'll succeed. " " "
and instead of panic, it just stopped.
he stopped the whole mental process, and he did something with everything and everything again.
" he got a look at the sky and said, " " sorry, don't you see that i'm on the wheel? " " "
" " " do you seem to write a song now? "
if you really want to exist, come back to a better moment, when i can do it.
if you don' t, and they bother someone else.
" go to and bother leonard cohen. " " "
the whole creative process has changed after that.
not opera, opera continued to be as dark as it is always.
but the process itself, and the whole agnoasa around it has been eagerd at the moment that he took the spiridus, the brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant genius, and he's given his way to go back to where he
it could be this unique, wonderful and bizarre collaboration in the form of a conversation between tom and the outer entity, strange that wasn't too much like tom.
after hearing the story, i started to change a little bit that i was working on and already saved me.
" this approach saved me when i was in the middle of the novel, " " eat, pray, love, " " and i fell into some kind of desperation that we all fall in when we're working on something that doesn't come out and start thinking of you as a disaster, that
not just bad, it's the worst book ever written.
i started thinking that i should just abandon the project.
that's when i remembered tom talking to open space, and i tried.
i stood up from the manuscript, and i said the comments to a hole of the room.
" i said, " " listen, being, and you know, if this book is not extraordinary, it's not just my fault, right? "
because you can see that i'm putting it up all i have to get out, and more than that, i can' t.
so if you want to be better than that, you have to do your defense and make your job.
okay. and if you're not going to do this, you know something, in the hell with everything.
i'll keep writing because that's my job.
" and i want to conceive for today that i did my job. " " "
because--the conclusion is, ok--hundreds of years ago in the deserts north africa's deserts used to bring together to celebrate the moon through dances and musical music that lasted for hours to race.
and they were always wonderful, because dancers were professionals and they were remarkable, right?
but sometimes, very rarely, something happens, and one of the interpretis really was coming out of common.
i'm sure you all know what i mean, because you've all seen, at some point, such a interpretation.
it's as though the dancer stops through some sort of portal, and even though it doesn't do anything different than usually, in the other thousand seriously, everything is aligned.
suddenly it doesn't seem to be entirely human.
it's luxury from the inside and the bottom lights are pushing by the fire of divorce.
when people were happening, they knew what was, and they told him.
" and they started to scanned, " " allah, alllah, alllah, god, ladies, ladies. " " "
it's god.
" an interesting istoric montd--when mauics invaded south spain, they took this habit and pronourished over centuries of" " allah, allah, allah, allah, allah. " " "
and they're still hearing during the fight with yours and flamenco dances.
" in spain, when an interpret has done something impossible and magic is shouting, " " allah, ole, ole, allah, allah, magnificent, bravo. " " "
now, i mean, this is a no-class of god.
it's great because we need something like that.
but the hard part comes the next morning when the dancer itself gets up and discovering that it's mars, 11 in the morning, and it's no longer a sclipire of the divtine.
it's a dead died that i want knees and maybe never go up to the height.
could nobody invoke the name of the gentleman when he rotates, so what is it supposed to be supposed to do with his rest of his life?
it's hard.
it's one of the most painful acceptance to do in creative life.
but maybe it wouldn't be such a big chin if you don't think of it from the beginning, that your most extraordinary parts of your being come from.
maybe if you've just thought you've been boring by a heart source for a few splendid moments of your life is going to be given to somebody else's data, when those moments have gone.
if we think about it, it all starts to change.
so i started thinking, and so i certainly thought in the last couple of months at the book that's going to be published soon, an exciting sequel of waiting, dangerous and scary of my weird success.
and what i've done, when i lose my courage is: it doesn't fear.
it's not scared. just do your job continues to make your side, whatever it is.
if you're a dancer, then they dance.
" if the genius of divin and excentric what you're going to do is decide to let the extraordinary thing, even for a moment through your efforts, then" " ole! " " "
and if not, they dance anyway.
" and yet, " " ole! " " for you. "
i believe in these things, and i think we should teach them.
" " " ole! " " for you, though, just because you have a clean love for humanity and stubborn to participate in. "
thank you.
thank you.
june cohen: ole!
i've talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what he could represent, and about finding new sets of genes.
now we're starting, in fact, from a new point: we've digitized biology, and now we're trying to start from this digital code and go into a new phase of biology, modeling and synthesized life forms.
we've always tried to ask ourselves important questions.
" " " what is life? " " it's something that i think many biologists have tried to understand at various levels. "
i tried different approaches, simplify life on basic components.
we already digitize about 20 years.
when i sequenced the human genome, this went from the analog world of biology in the digital world of the computer.
now we're trying to ask: can we regenerate life, or can we create new forms of life, from this digital universe?
this is the map of a small organism, mycoplasma genitalium, who has the smallest genome for a species that can replicate themselves in the lab.
we tried to see if we could come up with a smaller genome.
we managed to suppress the order of a hundred genes around 500 who are there.
but when we look at the metabolic map, it's pretty simple in comparison to ours.
believe me, this is simple.
but when we look at all the genes that we can suppress at some point, it's a little bit likely to produce a living cell.
so i decided that the only way before we actually synthesize this chromosome, so that we could vary the components to address some of the most fundamental questions.
" and so i started on the way, " " can we synthesize a chromosome? " " "
can chimia enables these very large molecules that we never have done before?
and if, can we activate a chromosome?
a chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
so our speed of digitize life grew up at an exponentially pace.
our ability to write genetic code is moving pretty slowly, but it grew up.
the last time it came to an exponential curve.
i started this more than 15 years ago.
i went through a few stages, starting, in fact, with a bio-etic expression before doing the first experiments.
but it turns out that dna synthetic is very difficult.
there are tens of thousands of machines in the world doing small pieces of dna, 30 to 50 letters, but it's a degenerative process, so why you build a much longer piece, the more errors appear.
so we had to create a new way to put these small pieces together and correct all the errors.
this was our first tentativa, starting from the digital information, to synthesize phi x 174's genome.
it's a small virus that kills bacteria.
we did the design of pieces, we went through the correctity of errors, and we got a dna molecule only about 5, 000 letters.
the interesting part came when i took this piece of chemical material inert and put it into bacteria, and bacteria started reading this genetic code, and produce the bits of the virus.
viral particles were released from cells and turned around and killed the e. coli cells.
i was talking to the oil industry recently, and i was saying that i really understand this pattern.
they laugh more than you.
and so we think this is a situation where software can build their own hardware in a biological system.
but we wanted to do something bigger.
we wanted to build the whole chromosome of a bacteria.
this is over 2, 000 genetic code letters.
so we said to put letters in the size of viruses to be able to, in fact, vary the size of houses to understand what are the real components of a living cell.
design is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer, that information has to be very accurate.
when i first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standards of precision was about 10, 000 pairs of base.
i found the resecventional, 30 errors. if i used the original sequence, that could never be activated.
part of the design is designing some pieces of pieces, which has 50 letters, who have to overlap with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller sub-units, we need to design that the bits should be compatible with each other.
we're designing unique elements.
" you may read that we put" " watermarks" " in the homes. think about this: we have a genetic code made out of four letters: " " "
triplete from those letters--those letters encoded about 20 amino acids--one letter is the only letter we're doing every acid amino.
so we can use the genetic code to write words, sentences, thoughts.
initially, all we did was self-caring.
some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
we designed those pieces so we could digest them with enzymes.
they're enzymes that are repairing them and they bring them together.
so we started doing the pieces, starting five to 7, 000 letters, matching them to do 24, 000 letters, and then putting these sets of sets of sets together, going to 72, 000.
every stage, i multiply these pieces of abundance to sequence them, because we're trying to create a very robust process--as you'll see in a minute.
we're trying to get to that point of automation.
so, this looks like a basket field.
when we get to a very large piece of pieces, over 100, 000 pairs of base, they don't grow that easy in e. coli.
they epulate all the tools of modern molecular biology.
so we went to other mechanism.
i knew there was a mechanism called recombination recombination, which biology uses to repair dna, and that connects pieces.
this is an example.
there's a organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can support millions of radiation wars.
as you can see in the top panel, his chromosome is destroyed in bits.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it again again as it was at first.
we have thousands of organisms that can do that.
these organisms can be completely left.
they can live in the vacuum.
i'm absolutely sure that life can be in alien space, move, find a new umed environment.
in fact, nasa showed that this is happening there.
here's a micrographical of a molecule that we built--using these processes--actually, using only yeast yeast detection with the appropriate design of the pieces that we put inside.
yeah, yeah, yeah, they put them together automatically.
this is not a picture from a electron microscope, just a regular micrographical photo.
it's such a big molecule that we can see it with a optic microscope.
these are images collected over a period of about six seconds.
this is an published that i had a little while ago.
these are over 2, 000 letters of genetic code.
it's the biggest molecule ever done by people, with a defined structure.
it has a molecular table of over 300 million.
if we print it with a type of 10 and without spaces, it takes a thousand pages to print this genetic code.
so how do we start a chromosome? how do we activate it?
obviously, a virus is pretty easy.
but it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
it's also easier when you get to the self, like us: you can just take the nucleus and put another one, and that's something you've all heard--cloning.
with archaea bacteria, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we've shown that we can do a completely transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another, and we can activate it.
i wore a crozom from one of the microbial species.
these are about as distances as people and mice.
we added some genes to select for this chromosome.
we digest it with enzymes to kill all proteins.
and it was pretty amazing when we put it into the cell--you will appreciate our very sophisticated graphs--and the chromosome came into the cell.
in fact, i thought this is how far it can go, but we tried to design something further.
this is a major mechanism of evolution.
we find all kinds of species embedded a second chromosome, or a third one, from the other hand, adding the species, thousands of new features in a second.
so those of you who think about evolution just like one gene changing at some point they lost a lot of biology.
they're enzyme, called restriction enzyme, which actually digest dna.
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have it.
the cell--the chromosome we put in.
it was expressing and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material, digest it, and that's how we just got the cell with the new chromosome.
it became blue because of the genes i put into chromosomes.
and after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species lost, and it turned into a new species, based on the software that we put in the cell.
all proteins were changed, membranes were changed--when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we transferred.
this may sound like genomics alchemist alchemist, but we can move to dna software to change pretty dramatic stuff.
now, i said that this is not genes--it's built on three and a half years of evolution; and i said that maybe we're on the way to create a new version of cambrian explosion, where there's a new massive species based on digital design.
why do we do that?
i think it's pretty obvious to be a needle.
we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over 40 years.
to put this in context for myself: i was born in 1946.
now there are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946; in 40, there will be four.
we have trouble feeding, providing drinking water, drugs, fueling six and a half billion.
it's going to be difficult to do it for us.
we use more than five billion tons of coal, more than 30 billion barrels of oil.
that's a hundred million barrels a day.
when we're going to try to think about biological processes or any process that replace this, it's going to be a huge challenge.
and then, of course, it's all that co2 from this material, which goes into the atmosphere.
now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a database of over 20 million genes, and i like to think of it as the design components in the future.
electronic industry only has a dozen, or something like this, and here's the diversity that came out of it.
we're limited here, first of all, a biological reality and our imagination.
we now have techniques, due to these quick methods of synthesis, to do what we call, brilliant combinators.
we have the ability to build a big robot to do a million chromosomes a day.
when you think about processing these 20 million different genes, or try to optimize processes to produce octan, or pharmaceutical products, new vaccines, we can change only with a small team, to make more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science.
and that's just standard selection.
we can select viability, chemical chemical production or fuel production, vaccines production, etc.
this is a screen capture of a design software that we're working on, to be able to sit down and work on these species into the computer.
you know, we don't necessarily know what it's going to look like.
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
now we're focusing on fuels to the fourth generation.
you've seen recently that from corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment.
we have the third generation of the generation of the second and third that will come pretty soon, which are sugars, at higher fuels like octan or different types of butanol.
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without growing the cost of food and without limiting their availability is if we start with co2 as the first matter, and we work to design cells for this goal, and we think we'll have the first fuel fuels of the fourth generation in
sunlight and co2 is a method--but in our discoveries around the world, we have all kinds of other methods.
this is an organism that i described in 1996.
it lives in the deep ocean, about two kilometers and a half in the depth, to temperature temperature.
it turns co2 into methane using hydrogen molecular as energy source.
we're trying to see if we can take co2 capture, which can be easy to transport in the pipe, and convert that co2 back to fuel, to lead this process.
" so in a short period of time, we think we could increase what the basic question is, " " what is life? " " "
we really, you know--we've got the very intricate goals to replace the entire petro-chemical industry.
yeah. if you can't do that at ted, where else else?
become a major energy source.
but we're also working now to use these same sources to invent vaccines immediately.
you saw this year with flu, we're always a year ago and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
i think the situation can be changed by building vaccines before.
here's how to start showing the future by changing the tree of evolution, accelerate the evolution of synthetic bacteria, archea, and finally, kariote.
we're almost to improve people.
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive enough to do that. thank you very much.
what i want to show you first, very quickly, is a fundamental work, a new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of a purchase about a year ago. this is seadragon.
it's an environment that can interact either local or distance with a great amount of visual data.
we're looking at many now, many gigabaits of digital pictures and marind almost perfect, panoramaing through this, rearranging it anyway.
it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big images are.
most of them are pictures of a regular digital camera, but this one, for example, is a scanning from the library of congress, from the order of 300 megapixels.
it doesn't matter because the only thing that should be limiting the performance of such a system is the number of pixels of your monitor at some point. it's also a very flexible architecture.
this is a whole book, a non-imaginative example.
" it's charles dickens' house, " " charles dickens. every column represents a chapter. "
to show you that it's about text, and not a picture, we can do that, to really show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a picture.
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronics format.
i wouldn't recommend.
" this is a more real case. it's a" " the fence" " -ui. "
every image represents the beginning of a section.
this really gives you a enjoyable experience of reading the pattern of a magazines or a newspaper, which is inherently inherently multi-dimensional environment.
" we did something small with the corner of this number in" " gardian. " " "
we created a false ad in a very large resolution--much larger than any average ad--and embedded a extra content.
if you want to see the properties of this car, you can see them here.
or other models, or even technology.
and that's really catching to some ideas, taking the limits of a monitor.
we hope that this is going to be the pop-up and other people who are like this--which is not necessary.
of course, mapation is one of the obvious applications for a technology like this.
i'm not going to make a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have to contribute to this domain.
these are all the roads in the united states over a geospatial image from nasa.
let's go to something else.
this is actually active on the internet right now; you can check.
this is a project called photosynth, and it's a couple of different technologies. one of them is seadragon, and the other great research in the field of visually computer perception made by noah snavely, graduate from university in washington, indrumting by steve seitz
and rick szeliski on microsoft research. beautiful collaboration.
and so this is active on the internet. it's possible because of the seadragon.
you can see that when we create this kind of perspectives, when we can navigate through images, we can have this kind of experience in many resolutions.
but the space arrangement of these images really matters.
visual perception algorithms recorded these images together so that they could correspond to real space where these pictures--they all do next to the grasslands in the u. s. rocks--they've been done. you can see these elements here in a stabilized or panoramaing project, and these elements have been
i'm not sure if i have time to show you other environments.
there are some that have much more spaceity.
i'd like to go directly to one of the original sets of noah--this is part of a early photosynth prototype that i've been working on in summer--to show you what i think is the resilient piece of this technology, photosynth technology. it's not
we had to take care of legal issues and so on.
that's a reconstruct of notre dame cathedral of flickr imagery on flickr. just look for notre dame on flickr, and you find something pictures in the t-shirt, campus. m. d. and each one of these oranges are a picture that was found that
these are pictures on the flickr, and they all had space relationate in this way.
we can just navigate this way.
you know, i never thought i'd get to work on microsoft is very magulitor to have a first one here.
i guess you're noticed that there's a lot of cameras: all of the range of cell phone phones at professional slr, even a really big number, shared in this environment.
if i can, i'm going to find out of this strange.
there's so many male machines, and so on.
somewhere here is a series of photographs--here we go.
this is a notre dame poster that was recorded right.
you can get away from the poster to a physical environment of this environment.
the point is that you can do things with the social environment. this is to collect data from everybody--from a whole collective memory about what the visual earth meant--and interconnect it. all those pictures have been interconnected, became something emerging than the sum of the parts.
you have a model of what comes out of the whole earth.
" think about that as the long tail of stephen lawler' s" " virtual earth. " " "
and this grows in complexity as the world uses it, and whose benefits get bigger as users use it.
the pictures are labeled with meta-data that someone else introduced.
if anybody labeled all of these sfinti, and they would say who i am, then my personal cathedral of notre dame would suddenly improve with all of this data, and i could use it as a pleasure point to navigate through that space, to make a kind of combined social experience.
and, of course, a second product of all this is huge and rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, collectors not only from flying over the earth and satellite images of satellite images, but from a collective memory.
thank you very much.
chris anderson: did i get it right? what will you allow your software, is that at some point, over the next few years, is that all pictures share from anyone on the world to be interrelationtion?
baa: yeah. what it really does is discover.
it creates hyper-connected, if you will, between images.
and they realize that based on the content of images.
and this becomes exciting when you think about the repository information that those images have.
that when you're doing a search of images on the internet, you're looking for words, and the internet's text gives a lot of information about what this picture is.
now, what if that picture is about all your pictures?
that's when the amount of semantic interconnected and wealth that comes from this is huge. it's where the classic network effect.
ca: blaise, it's really incredible. congratulations.
baa: thank you very much.
one of the intense pleasures of the journey, and one of the joy of etnography research is the opportunity to live among those who haven't forgotten the old dogs, who still feel their past in the wind, touching it in the slefficient rocks, tastes it into the bitter
it's only knowing that the jaguar shamans travel beyond the milky way, or the myths of the elderly still resonates with meaning, or in the himalaia buddhists still continues to dharma's breath, is to actually remember the central anthropologist
the consequence of a certain set of adaptive decisions that our ancestors have taken, although successful, with many generations behind.
and of course, we all share the same adaptive imperative.
we're all born. we're all bringing kids around the world.
we go through rituals of initiation.
we need to deal with the uniertators of death, so we shouldn't surprise that we all sing, we dance, we all have art.
but what's interesting is the unique case of the song, the pace of dance every culture.
whether it's the penan tribe in the forests in borneo, or the voodoo depts in haiti, or the warrior in the kaisut desert north kenya, the curandero tribes of the year, or a caravanai in the middle of the sahara.
by the way, this is the guy i've traveled to desert a month ago, or even a pastor of rabbits on the qomolangma pantele, everestul, the god god of the world.
all of these people teach us that there are other ways to be, other ways to think, other ways to hook you on earth.
and this idea, if you think about it, it can't just fill your hope.
now, the odor of cultures of the world together form a network of spirital and cultural life covering the planet, and it's as important for the health of the planet as the biological network of life, known as biosphere.
and you might think of this network of life as being etnosphere, and you could define etnosphere as being the sum of all dreams, theths, the ideas, the inspirations, the intuition, the intuition of the human imagination from the zoigrade of consciousness.
etnosphere is the great legacy of humanity.
it's the symbol of what we are and everything we can be as a surprising species of purpose.
and as biosphere was severe error, so etnosphere--and maybe a much larger scale.
for example, no biologists would dare suggest that half or more of all species has been or is at the edge of extinction, because it's just not true, and yet--the most apocalyptic scenario in biological diversity--it's just approaching what we know the most optimi
and the biggest indicator of this is of course the extinction of languages.
when you were born, those of you in this room, there were 6, 000 language spoken on the planet.
now, a language is not just a vocabulary or a set of rules of grammar.
one language is a spark of human spirit.
it's the vehicle by which the soul of every particular cultures goes into the material world.
every language is a rainforest of the mind, a receptual, a thought, a spiritual possibility ecosystem.
and from those 6, 000 languages, as we're sitting here in monterey, half of them are no longer shocked in the ear of children.
they're no longer taught babies, which means, if they don't change something, that they are already dead language.
what can be lonely than being surrounded by silence, being the last of yourself talking to your language, not having the way to teach the wisdom of ancestors or anticipate the promise of children?
and yet, that fateful fate really is somebody's trouble somewhere on earth, about every two weeks, because every two weeks, a old dies, and it leads to it in the past silabe resorts of a ancient language.
" and i know some of you will say, " " well, wouldn't it be better? "
" wouldn't the world be a better place if we all talk a single language? " " and i say, " " great, that language would be yoruba. or it's causing. "
" or be kogi. " " "
and then you will suddenly discover what it would be not to be able to talk to your own language.
so, what i want to do today with you is a kind of journey through etnosphere--a quick journey through etnospheres to try to give you a sense of what's actually losing.
" now, there are many of us who seem to forget that when they say, " " different ways of being, " " i really understand different ways of being. "
let's take this kid from the barasana tribes in the north-west amazon, the anacondei people who think that mitologic--they came up on the laptos river, from east, in the belly snakes.
this is a people who through rise to not distinguish the blue color of green because the leaves of the sky is equal by the rainforest that people depend on.
i have a curious language and marriage rules called exrogatal linguistics: you have to marry someone who talks another language.
and all of this is rooted in the mitological past, yet it's a strange thing in these long homes where six or seven languages talk to the intervention, you never hear someone exposed to language.
they just listen and then start talking to foreign language.
or, one of the most fascinating tribes i've ever experienced, the waorani tribe of the northeast ecuador, a remarkable people, contacted peacefully in 1958.
in 1957, five missions tried to contact them and made a critical mistake.
they threw off the photographic photos with themselves themselves in what they wanted to be a friendful gesture, forget that these people in the tropical jungle didn't see in their two-dimensional life.
they took those pictures on the ground, they tried to look behind the girl to find shape or figure out, they found nothing, they've fired that these are the sheet books of the devil, so they killed the five-missionary mission.
but waorani doesn't kill the chains just strangers.
they were killing each other.
54 percent of their mortality are due to killing with the chain.
i followed the tree tree back to eight generations, and i found two cases of natural death, and when i press them a little bit about them, they had come to guess that one guys had so old that he died aging, so i responded him with lancea anyway. but at the same time
their hunters can smell the animal from 40 steps and tell you what the species left it behind.
in the early 1980s, i had a surprising mission when i was asked by my teacher at harvard if i was interested in haiti, to infiltrat my secret societies that were the basis of duvalier and a tonton macoutes, and to get poison used to create zombi.
to understand what's hiding behind the sensation, i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vodoun, voodoo is not a dark culture.
it's a very complex metaphysical look at the world.
it's interesting.
if i asked you what are the great religions of the world, what would you say?
christianity, islamism, buddhism, judaism, anything else.
it always remains a continent, the assumption that sub-saharan africa didn't have religious faiths. well, of course, voodoo was simple distilled of these very profound religious ideas that went through the ocean at the time of diaspore tragic tragic in the era of
but, what voodoo does so interesting is this life relationship between living and deadly.
so the living one gives rise to spirits.
spirits can be invocate from the seawater, that answer to the dance of the dance to replace the soul of the living soul, so that for that short, luminous moment becomes the god.
" that's why i say voodoo practice like" " you, white people, go to church and speak of god. "
" we dance in the temple and we become god. " " "
and because you're in charge, you're dominated by spirit, how could you be vatamated?
so you can see these amazing demonstrations: the voodoo state of transa-manuind games burning in perfect safety, a pretty remarkable demonstration of the capacity of the mind to affect the body that carries him, when it's catalyzed in the extremeness.
now, from all the peoples i met most extraordinary is the kogi people in sierra nevada of santa marta in north colombia.
the descendants of the old tairona civilization, once the caribebie coast of colombia immediately on the spanish cube, this people went to a isolated slaughter that lifts over the caribean coastal plain plains.
in a square continent of blood, this people is the unique that hasn't been conquered by spanish.
until today, they're driven by a ritual priest, but the training to be preparing is pretty extraordinary.
young kids are ruined by their families at three to four years old, and they're in a dark world of shadow humiliation at the bottom of the glaciers, for 18.
two nine-year-olds elected deliberately to mimic the nine months of gestatia spending in their natural mom, they're now metaphoring in the uterus of nature.
and on the whole duration, they're introduced in values of their society, values that are supporting in their prayers and only their prayer maintaining the cosmic balance--or we could say equilibrium eco-balance.
at the end of this amazing initiative, one day i'm suddenly pulled out and for the first time in their life, at age 18, they see a race. and in that clean moment of consciousness of first light, as the sun starts to break down the panther of beautiful amp; suddenly, all
" and he says, " " see? it really is like i said. "
" it's so beautiful. it's yours to protect it. " " "
they're called older siblings, and they say that we, who are younger brothers, we are responsible for destruction of the world.
now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
whenever we think about the cane and the landscape, or we're invoking rousseau and the old flag of the wild nobil, which is a racial idea in her simplicity, or alternativ, we're thoreau, and we say that these people are closer to earth than we
well, bastinasii are not a feeling, no weakness of nostalgia.
it's not too place for none in the swamp of malaria or in frozen winds of tibet, but they've done it, through time and ritual, created a traditional motion of the earth, which is based on the idea of being closer to him, but through a much more subtle intuit
now, what does that mean?
it means that a little boy in the year that's grown to believe that that mountain is the spirit that's going to come to the destiny, it's going to be a profound human being, and it's going to have a different relationship with that resource or that place than a little
that it's a spirit or a lot of mines is irrelevant.
interesting is the metaphor that defines the connection between the individual and the natural world.
i grew up in the british columbie forests to believe that forests were there to be cut.
this made me a human being than my friend of kwagiulth tribe, who believes that those forests were huxwhukw and the incovoiat chip in the heaven and the canibate spirits who lived at the north of the world, spirits that had to go into the battle
if you start to examine the idea that these cultures could create different reality, you will begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. let's take this plant.
it's a picture taken by me in the north-west amazon, april.
this is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard, the most powerful psychiatric psychiatric in the repertoire of the saman.
ayahuasca is not just fascinating for the potential pharmacology of leaton, but for his prepare. it's made of two different sources.
the first is this guy who has a beta series, harmin, harmalina, moderat halucinogen.
it only consumes the pie is more likely to have a kind of blue smoke that slaughters over your consciousness, but the one is mixed with the leaves of an arbust in the cafelei called the psychotria viridis.
this plant contains a very strong tryptamine, very close to serotonin in the brain, the fifthhyltryptamine, 5, methoxydimethyltryptamine.
if you ever saw people in yanomami pulling that dust look at their noses, that substance is made of different species that contain and methoxydimethyltryptamine.
it pulls that threshold through the nose is actually as if you're expulated from a gun gun with baroce paintings and landing in a big electricity. it doesn't create a distortion of reality; it creates a disability of reality.
in fact, we were discussing with my richard evan shultes professor--which is the man who triggered was psychopath, and it was psychopath fungi in mexico in the 1930s.
i used to argue that you can't classic these tryptamine as halucinogene, because at the time you're underneath their effect is nobody at home to live a hallucination. the problem with tryptamine is that they can't be taken oral, because they' re
they can only be taken oral together with other chemical compounds that denature mao.
now, the fascinating thing is that the beta-carbolinees found in that one is inhibies exactly the guy necessary to fit tryptamine. so you ask yourself, how on a 80, 000 species of vascularized plants, they found these people these two morphysical
well, we use that great euphemism, trial and error, which is definitely clear as meaningless.
" but you ask indians, and they say, " " plants are speaking. " " "
well, what does that mean?
this cofan tribe has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, and i recognize all of them in the forest from the distance, and we see them as one species.
" and then you ask them how to set their taxonomy and they say, " " i thought you knew something about plants. "
" i mean, do you really don't know anything? " " and i say, " " no. " " "
well, we find out every one of 17 varieties in one night with a full moon, and they put you in a different note.
now, that's not going to bring your ph. d. to harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamine.
now, the problem is that even those of us sympathetic difficulties, we see them as bizari and colorfulness, but kind of reduced to the edge of history as the world, that is our world, develop.
the fact is that the 20th century, over 300 years, it's not going to be mindful for wars or technological innovation, but rather that the age that we've been engaging and or encourage active or embracing passive passive destruction of biological diversities and cultural diversity on the planet. the problem
all cultures in all time were constantly hired in a dance with new possibilities of life.
and the problem is not technology itself.
indians didn't slow down to be sioux when they gave up the spring and arrow, more than the americans stopped americans, when they gave up the horse and the route.
not changing or technology threatens the integrity of etnosphere. it's power.
the cruel face of dominance.
wherever you look around the world, you find that these are not growing cultures.
these are dynamic people living dynamic being pulled out of the existence of identifyive forces that are over their adaptation.
whether it's the ferocious deforestation in the 19th century--a nomad popor in southern asia--from sarawak--a people who lived free in the forest behind a generation, and now all being reduced to slavery and prostitution on the rivers of rivers, where you
where the japanese vessels sit at the horizon ready to fill their horse with your bustenis in the forest.
or in the case of yanomami, there are diseases that came outside, in the zoker of the gold discoveries.
or if we go to the mountain of tibet, where a lot of research do in the last time, you'll see the cruel face of political dominance.
you know, genocide, the physics of a people's physics is universal convicted, but ethncid, destroying the way of the life of a people not only is convicted, but it's universal celebration--in many areas--as part of the development strategies.
and you can't understand the pain of tibet until you travel through it at the ground level.
i've traveled to 9.600 kilometers from chengdu in chinese west, by the south of tibet to lhasa with a young man, and only when i got to lhasa, i understood what's behind the statistics you've heard.
6, 000 monuments transformed into dust and ashamed.
1.2 million people killed by communist frames during the cultural revolution.
the father of this young man was devoted by panchen lama.
that meant the immediate killing when chinese invaded tibet.
his uncle ran panchen lama in diaspora in nepal.
his mother was intense for the crime to be instaron.
he was broken on the ant in prison at the age of two to hide under the mother's ski, because she couldn't stand without him.
the sister that made that brave fact was thrown in a reeducation camp.
one day she traveled from our citizens on a mao gang, and for this crime she got seven years of silnica work.
tibet pain can be impossible to support, but the mantuitor spirit of people is something admired.
and finally, in fact, it's all about a choice.
do we want to live in a monochma world, or do we want to accept a polymer world of diversity?
margaret mead, the great anthropologist, before you were to die that her biggest fear was that as i slipped to this generic and numb of the world not only will see the whole range of human imagination to a more narrow way of thinking, but that we're going to
and it's humiliating to remember that our species exist, maybe about 600, 000 years.
the neolitic revolution--which gave us agriculture, at which point where we gave the cult of the shaman, the poem of the shadow was replaced by the preotial proza, we created a hierarchical surplus--it was only 10, 000 years ago.
the modern industrial world as we know it has only 300 years.
now, this superficial history doesn't suggest that we had all the answers to all the challenges that we're going to face in the next millennia.
when this multitude of cultures of the world are asked about the meaning of humanity, they respond to 10, 000 different voices.
and in that song, we'll all discover all of us to be what we are: a completely conscious species, completely aware of insurance that all people and all gardens find a way to thrive. and there are wonderful moments of optimism.
this is a photograph that i did at the north of baffin islands when i went to narlogy hunters with some people in the inuit, and this man, olayuk told me the fantastic story of his grandfather.
the canadian government hasn't always been so well-being with the inuit, and in the 1950s, to stabil our sovereignity, we forced them into the colonies.
the grandfather of this man refused to go.
the family, the fear for his life, took all the guns and all the tools.
now, you have to understand that the inuits are not fear of fear, they use the fear in their advantage.
the guess of their breasts were made of original fish in skin skin.
so the grandfather of this man wasn't intimidated by the arctic night or the dream that blows.
he just slipped out, and he pulled the pants of the fire skin and defecating it in his hands. and how the excrements started frozen, he formed from him a kind of lemon.
he put saliva on the box of the knife in the excrements and finally he frozen bocna, he injunghiaed a dog with him.
he played the dog and improvise a harnasament, taken the toractive box of dog and improvise a slight, inhamat an invecinat dog, and disappeared over floating ice, having the knife in brau.
and we're going to talk to you out of nothing. and that's in many ways, it's a symbol of the resistance of the people inuit and all the people in the people around the world.
aprilie 1999 government gave back to the total control of a larger area than california and texas together.
it's our new patrie. it's called nunavut.
it's an independent territory. the inuit controls all the minerals of minerals.
an amazing example of how a national state can look and find repairs for his people.
and finally, finally, i think it's obvious that at least for us that we've traveled to these distant places of the planet, i realized that they're not distant at all.
they are the pathrs of people.
they represent the branches of human imagination coming from the dawn of time. and for all of us, the dream of these kids, as our dreams of our children, become part of the free geography of hope.
what we've been trying to do at national geographic is, we think politicians won't ever do anything.
we believe that polemics--we believe that polemics aren't compelling, but we think that stories can change the world, and so we're probably the institution in the world that's the best.
we have 35 million visit on our web page every month.
156 nations transmit our television channel.
our magazines are reading millions of people.
and what we're doing is a series of journey in etnosphere, where we're going to take our audience in places like this kind of cultural wonder that they can't just stay fascination of what they've seen, and we hope that they're going to accept gradually, one
where all the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective prosperity.
thank you very much.
i'm going to talk to you about some things in a book that i hope that they're going to resonate with other things that you've already heard, and i'm going to try and do some connections, in case you missed them.
" i want to start with what i call" " official doctrina. " " "
the official doctrine of what?
the official doctrina of all industrialized industrialized society.
and this official doctrina sound like this: if we're interested in maximizing our own level of citizens, the way to achieve it is to maximize the level of individual freedom.
the reason for that is that freedom is intrinsically good, valuable, meritorie, essential to being human.
and because if people are free, then each of us can act individually and doing things that will maximize our well-being, and no one must decide in our place.
the way to maximize freedom is the maximization of choice.
the more elections, the more people have, the more freedom, and the more freedom they have, the more imbelates.
that, i think, it's so well incastrated in our system that they wouldn't get anybody through the head put it in question.
and it's deeply implemented in our lives.
i'm going to give you a few examples of what made it happen for us progress in the last time.
this is a supermarket. not a big one.
i mean only two words about the salad sauce.
175 sauce for the salad in my supermarket, that if we don't shock the 10 different kinds of ultra-rafinate olive oil and the 12 steel steels that you can buy to make your own salad sauce in a very large number, in case none of the 175 that the store give
so this is the supermarket.
and then you go to the electronic components store to configure a stereo system--boxe, cd player, casetofon, transformator, amplifier.
and in this electronic components store there's a lot of stereo systems.
we can configure six and a half million stereo systems in the components that are in the offer of a single store.
you have to recognize that this is a lot of choices.
in other areas--in the world of communications.
there was a era, when i was a kid, where you could get any phone service ever wanted as long as ma bell was offered.
you rent the phone. you don't buy it.
by the way, one of the consequences of this was that the phone never was broken.
and those days are taken off.
now, we have a huge diversity of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
these are the cell phones of the future.
my favorite is in the middle--with mp3 player, the hair machine in the nose and torta to make sugar crema ars.
and if you haven't seen it yet in the store you can't stand quiet because you'll see it.
and the result is that it makes people enter the shops and ask this question.
and you know what the answer to the question?
" the answer is" " no. " " it's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't know much. "
and in other areas of life that are much more important than shopping, there's this raw growth of the number of options.
sanitation--in the united states, it's no longer the case you go to your doctor, and that's telling you what to do.
instead, you go to the doctor, and that says, well, we have the option of b.
it has these benefits and these risks.
b has these benefits and these risks. what do you want to do?
" and you're saying, " " doctors, what do you do? " " and the doctor says, he has these benefits and these risks and b advantages and these risks. "
what do you want to do?
" and you say, " " but if you were in my place, what would you do? " " and the doctor says, " " but i'm not in your place. " " and the result is--we tell him, " " the patient' s" " what makes it beneficial.
but what's actually a transition of responsibility and decision-making decisions from someone who knows something--in this doctor--somebody who knows nothing, and it's almost safely sick and not in the best form to make decisions--in this patient.
there's a huge amount of publicity for people with recipeing people like me and as you, what if you think about it, it has no logic, because we can't buy them.
why do we ask our new advertising if we can't buy them?
the answer is that those who are doing this is waiting for us to call our doctors in the next morning and ask them to change our networks.
something so important that our identity has now become a choice problem, and this transition has the role to show this.
that we don't inherited an identity but we have the opportunity to invent it.
and that we can reinvent as often as we have chef.
and that means that every day when you wake up you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
with all the respect for marriage and family has been an age where the assumption that you're starting almost everybody was that you have to marry how early you can, and then start having children as quickly as possible.
the only option was with who, not surely what you're going to do after that.
in our days, it's all very, very good at our fingertips.
i teach some incredibly intelligent students and i give them 20 percent less than i was doing.
and that's not because it's less smarter, not because it's less harnici.
" but because i'm concerned with all sorts of questions, " " should i marry or not? should i do it now? "
" should i marry later? should i first have kids, or a career? " " all of these are questions that consume you. "
and they're going to answer these questions, whether this means not to do all the homework they give and take a good note to my course.
and that's what they need to do. these are important questions that you have to answer.
work--we're blessed, as underlinia and technology that enables us to work every minute of every single day in every single place on the planet--less from the hotel randolph.
by the way, there's an area in a corner, which i didn't reveal anyone in which wireless works.
i'm not going to tell you about it because i want to use it.
so that means that this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, if we shouldn't work or we shouldn't work.
we can go see how our football kid play and have the mobile in a pocket and blackberry in the other and the laptop, probably on the knee.
" and even though they're closed every minute where we're looking at how the kid is moving a football game, we're asking, " " should i answer this call? "
" should i answer this email? should i write this letters? " " and even if the answer to the question is, " " no, it's not, it's certainly the football game experience of your kid would be very different than that. "
so wherever we look, big and small things, objects and things that keep your lifestyle, life is a matter of options.
and the world that we live in is something like this.
so let's say, we had some choices to do, but it wasn't all a choice.
and the world now we live in now look like this.
and the question is, is that good or bad?
and the answer is yes.
we all know what's right about this, so i'm going to talk about what's wrong.
all of these elections have two effects, two negative effects on people.
one of the effects, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.
with so many choices i can choose, people are very difficult to stop for something.
i give you a very significant example, a study about investments in private pensions.
a colleague of mine had access to the investment data from hunting, huge company of mutual funds that has about a million employees and almost 2, 000 people.
and what he found is that for every 10 mutual fund that the employers gave, the participation rate goes down with two percent.
offer 50 mutual funds--it's about 10 percent fewer employees than if you offer only five. why?
because with 50 mutual funds of choice, it's hard to decide to decide what you're going to choose to choose so you leave it tomorrow.
and then on the poimaine and then on the laughter and the laughter, all the troops, and of course, this laugh never comes before.
you know that that doesn't mean that those people are going to eat food for dogs after they're out of retirement because they don't have enough money to put aside, that means that the stability of a decision is so hard to do that you're giving up big money from the compensation funds
and they're going to regulate us, they're giving up the foot to 5, 000 dollars a year from the employer, which would be happy to pay them happily.
so the confidence is a consequence when you have too many choices.
and i think that makes people look like this.
do you really want to make the good decision if it's for all eternity, right?
you don't want to choose the wrong investment fund or even the sauce for the wrong salad.
so, this is an effect. the second is that if we can get rid of the incredible state and make a choice, we will be less satisfied with the outcome of choice than we were if we had fewer options to choose.
and there are a few reasons for that.
one of them is that having a bunch of saucers for the salad of choosing if i buy one and it's not perfect--and, you know, what sauce is?
it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would be better. and what happens is that the alternative that you imagine brings regrets to the choice that you did and these regrets are going out of satisfaction that you've got from the choices that you'
the more options you have, the easier to regret something that is disappointed about the option you've chosen.
secondly, what economists call opportunity cost.
dan gilber showed very clearly in this morning talking about how we evaluate things that we depend on.
well, when there's a lot of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the intrinsic features of the alternatives that you breathe, and that makes you less satisfying by the alternative you've chosen.
here's an example. i apologize people who are not new yorkers.
but here's how we should rational.
we have this couple in hamptons.
very expensive property.
lovely. a wonderful day. they have everything they need.
" what could you want more? " " well, dracu, " " it's like, " " it's august. "
all of my neighborhood in manhattan are left.
" i could actually go to front of the office. " " and i'm going to spend two weeks sacait of the idea that he's breaking a chance, day to have a wonderful parking parking park. "
opportunities are still running out of the satisfaction that we have from the election, even though what we choose is exceptional.
and the more choices to figure out, the more features of these options are going to be perceived by us as opportunities.
here's another example.
this cartoon says a lot of things.
it tells us that we should live the moment and perhaps we should do it slowly.
but one of the things that they tell is that whenever you choose a choice not to do other things.
and all the other things can have a lot of attractive traits, and that's going to do what you do less attractive.
third, the expectations of expectations.
that struck me when i wanted to replace my jeans.
port blugi almost all the time.
and there was a era where jeans were a single way and bought them as a dracu and they were incredibly unconfortable uncomfortable and if you were wearing them for a long time and washing them quite often getting off.
" so i went to replace my jeans after i was wearing for years old, and i said, " " look, i want a pair of jeans, that's my measure. " " and the vending said, " " you want to be bright, largi, right? "
do you want birth or fermoar? do you want them prespal or running in acid?
do you want it to be done?
" you want them to escape them, you want them right, blah blah blah blah. " " and it doesn't end. "
" and it took me, and after i came back, i said, " " i want to be the guy who was the only guy--he didn't have any idea that--so i spent an hour by all the jeans of jeans and left out of the store--this
we've chosen better. all of these options have done better choose.
but i felt worse.
why? i wrote a book where i tried to explain this.
the reason i felt worse is that given all of these options available to my expectations about how a pair of good jeans grew up.
i had very low expectations. i didn't have any expectation when i was one way.
now when i'm 100 sortiments, his mother, one of them must be perfect.
and what we got was good, but not perfect.
so i compared to what i got to do with what i expected and the result is i was disappointing compared to what i was hoping.
adding options in people's lives cannot do anything but to grow expectations that people have about how good they need to be.
and so that's going to lead to less satisfaction even though good results.
nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
because if you knew, you wouldn't have the idea of what i'm talking about.
the truth is more like this.
the reason it was better when everything was worse is that when everything was worse was actually possible that people could experience surprising surprises.
today, in the world that we live in--we, industrialized citizens and we had to wait perfection--the best thing you can hope is that things will be so good as they expect to be.
you will never be pleased surprised because your expectations and my expectations are high to the sky.
the secret of happiness--that's why you all come--the secret of happiness is to have reduced expectations.
i mean, just a quick autobiographical moment--that i actually have a wife, and it's really quite a wonderful right.
i could not have found something better. i didn't set up somewhere.
but let me sit at your house, not necessarily a bad thing.
finally, a consequence of buying a pair of jeans that doesn't get good when you can buy a single way is that when you're not happy and you won't ask you why they come from, the answer is clear.
the world is coming. what could you do?
when there are hundreds of different blobs of jeans available and buying one that you disappointing and ask you why, who's coming from?
it's as clear as the answer to the question is, you know.
you could have chosen better.
with a hundred different kinds of jeans at choice you have no excuse for failure.
so when people make decisions, even though the results of choices are good feels disappointed by them, they're innocent.
depression erupt in the industrialized world within the last generation.
i think an important contribution--not alone, but important to this eruption of depression and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointed because their standards are too high.
and when i have to explain these experiences, i think they're coming from.
so the general result is that we're getting it better, objective speaking, and we feel worse.
so let me remind you.
this is the official doctrina, that we all think of real and is completely false. it's not true.
without discussing a few choices is better than none, but that's not as much choices are better than a few.
there's a magic number. i don't know what it is.
but i'm pretty sure we've gone through that point where choices improve our lifestyle.
now, the idea--almost finished--the idea of the retinut, the thing to think about is this.
which allows all of these choices in industrialized society is material well-being.
there's a lot of places in the world, and i've heard about some of them where their problem is not that they have too many options.
the problem is they have too few.
so, the question i'm talking about is a strange problem of western societies, modern and rich.
and what's frustrating and suparator is this: steve levitt spoke yesterday about how these expensive kids are expensive and hard to install don't help. they're money throwing the window.
what i'm telling you is that these options, expensive and complicated not only can't help.
they really cause pain.
they really make us feel worse.
if something that allows us to do all the choices that we're doing would transfer in the societies where people have too few options not only that the lives of that would be improved, but also our lives would improve.
this is what economists call the pareto principle.
redistribute income will make us better--not just the poor people--because of the way that this choice of choices get sick.
" in conclusion. you're supposed to read this cartoon, and being a sophisticated person you'll say, " " a! what do you know this fish? "
" you know there's nothing possible in this aquarium. " " poor imagination, it's a great view of the world--that's how i read it and i first. "
but the more i thought about it, the more i got to believe that fish knows something.
because the truth is, if you break the aquarium because it's all possible, you don't have freedom anymore. you have inlemnire.
if you break the aquarium so that everything is possible, you're going to keep the satisfaction.
you click the confidence and you make satisfaction.
anybody needs a aquarium.
this is almost definitely limited--probably for a fish, but certainly for us.
but the absence of a metaphorical aquarium is a unfortunately network, and i assume, disaster.
thank you very much.
