a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman presented a design problem called the armor problem .
and the idea is pretty simple .
teams of four has to build the highest self @-@ state structure in 20 sticks of spaghetti , a adhesive tape tape , and a darkhouse .
the oil has to sit in the top .
and although it seems pretty simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and embedded it into a seminar of design .
and it was a great success .
and since then , i kept about 70 seminars of design all over the world with designers and architects , even the top 50 fortune directors , and something in this exercise took good learning about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share with you a few of you .
so , normally people start by evaluating the task .
talk about it , imagine what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s fighting for power , and then it &apos;s going to spend something time planning , organizing .
they &apos;re changing and they &apos;re showing the spaghettis most of their time assemble the sticks in the structure that are high , and then finally , when they don &apos;t have time , somebody &apos;s taking off the darkness , and put it delicate on the top , they &apos; re
they admire their work .
&quot; but what &apos;s actually happening in most cases , is that &quot; &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; &quot; turns into a &quot; &quot; oh @-@ oh , &quot; &quot; because the weight of the darkness makes the whole structure to deformeze and fall . &quot;
&quot; and there &apos;s a number of people who have much more moments of &quot; &quot; oh @-@ oh , &quot; &quot; than others , and among the most disbelievable people are found in business graduates . &quot;
they lie , cheating , lose their concentration , and they realize the jalnice structures .
&quot; and of course , there &apos;s teams that have a lot more structures , &quot; &quot; ta @-@ da , &quot; &quot; and , among the best people , they &apos;re kindergarten graduates . &quot;
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter says , it &apos;s not only producing the highest structures , it &apos;s also the most interesting of all .
so you &apos;d like to ask , how on earth ? why ? why ?
&quot; and peter likes to say , &quot; &quot; none of the kids don &apos;t lose time trying to be ceo at spaghetti srl . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it . &quot;
and it doesn &apos;t lose time fighting for power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
this is that students are trained to find the only plan right , right ?
and he &apos;s executed it .
and what &apos;s going on is that when they put the top , they &apos;re in the crisis of time , and what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? that &apos;s it .
what they do different kinds of kindergarten kids , is that they start with the bezeua , and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , keep in the top of the darkness , so they have more opportunities to remedie the prototypes wrong on the way .
so designers recognize this kind of collaboration as the essence of iterative process .
and every version , the kids have a immediate response to what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the ability to build in prototypes is essential , and let &apos;s see how different teams behaves .
so the average average is about 20 tols , students , are about half , lawyers , a little bit better , but not a lot of kindergarten children , better than most adults .
who &apos;s the best one ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , the highest structure i saw has 39 toles .
and why is that ? because they understand that triangles and models of self @-@ portant models are the key to build by stable structures .
so generali executives , a little bit better than the media .
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you add the team of a man from the waist , the result improves significantly .
&quot; it &apos;s incredible. you see , you look around and say , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the winning team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can say that before. why is that ?
because they have special competitions skills .
i run the process , i understand the process .
and any team that monitors , and it &apos;s attention to work will improve performance .
technically technical skills , and their combination leads to success garantat .
if you have 10 teams that begin to build , you &apos;ll have about six structures that are going to sit in .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s raise the stake .
and i gave a 10 thousand dollars in computer programs for the winner team .
and what do you think it happened to those students at design ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened .
no team has built something to stay on .
if any team were built , let &apos;s say , a three @-@ centimeter structure , it could have taken home .
so , it &apos;s not interesting that big stakes have a strong impact ?
i repeated the exercise with the same students .
what do you think has happened ?
now they &apos;ve just done the prototype value .
and the same team has gone from the weakest result to one of the best results .
they cost the highest structure in the shortest time .
so here &apos;s some deep lessons for us about nature of motivations and success .
so , could you ask , why would anyone lose time writing such a problem ?
and the reason is , i help to create digital tools and processes used by teams that are building machines and video games and visual effects .
and what this challenge does is it &apos;s that it &apos;s helping them identify hidden assumptions .
because , in fact , every project has its own fly , right ?
this challenge provides us a common experience , a common language , a common position in the building of a right prototype .
and so , this is the value of this experience , this exercise so simple .
and for those of you , you can access. marshmallowchallenge. com is a blog where you can see how to build with the darkness .
they &apos;re also peaceful instructions about it .
there are also unusual examples around the world as people change and adjust the system .
you can also find world records .
and the fundamental lesson , i think it &apos;s the fact that design really is a contact sport .
it asks us to dedicate all the senses , and apply what we &apos;ve got better thinking , feelings and facts for our challenge .
&quot; and sometimes , a simple prototype of this experience is the only thing we need to make a moment &quot; &quot; oh @-@ oh &quot; &quot; at a moment , &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that can make a difference .
thank you very much .
suppose we have a machine , a big machine , formidable , ted style , which is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to go into it .
you can go back or before , but you can &apos;t stay where you are .
i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i put friends this last night , and everybody wanted to travel back in time .
&quot; i don &apos;t know. they want to go back to the invention of the automobile , before twitter or &quot; &quot; american idol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a certain attraction to understand this .
but i have to say i &apos;m not part of this group .
i don &apos;t want to go back to time and not because i don &apos;t have the adventure spirit , but because that &apos;s the palette of options on this planet doesn &apos;t regress , it &apos;s moving .
so i want to go into the car and go ahead .
it &apos;s the best time of this planet you &apos;ve looked at : health , wealth , furniture , chance , chance , the descendants of sickness .
there was no longer no time .
all my grandparents died before 60 years old .
my grandparents came to 70 .
my parents come closer to 80 .
so there &apos;s good to be new figure at the beginning of the age that i &apos;m going to die .
but it &apos;s not even about people like this , because it &apos;s much more important than that .
a child who &apos;s born in new delhi has a higher life expectancy than she had the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that. it &apos;s an incredible phenomenon .
and why is that true ?
smallpox. smallpox killed billion people .
he repeated the demographic data of the planet in an unqualified way of anything else .
it &apos;s no longer. it &apos;s gone .
i &apos;ve convinced it. i &apos;ve got it .
in the rich world , diseases that threaten millions of people with only one generation ago .
difteria , rubeola , polio . . .
does anyone know what all that means ?
vaccines , modern drugs , our ability to feed billions of people are triumph of scientific methods .
and i think the scientific method , he put things to try , he saw if it works , it changes them if not , it &apos;s one of the most achievement of humanity .
these are good news .
unfortunately , there are no other problems because there are other problems , and there are many times , one of them , that despite all of our achievement , a billion people with sleeping every day .
this number grows very quickly , and it &apos;s rightly convicted .
not just that , but we used our imagination to destroy this planet completely .
drinking water , agricultural land , tropical forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re all on the sky and they &apos;ll disappear soon .
if we don &apos;t invent a way to come out of this mess , we will disappear .
the question is : can we do that ? i think yes .
i think it &apos;s obvious that we can produce food that feeds billions of people without devastation of the earth that i live in .
i think we can feed this world with energy that will not destroy it .
i really believe that , and it &apos;s not just an illusion .
but here &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t let me sleep at night--one of the things that don &apos;t let me sleep .
we never needed the progress of science than now , and we &apos;ve never ever learned in the situation to use it in the way we can do it today .
we &apos;re in the threshold of absolutely amazing events in more fields .
however , i think we should go back three hundred years before the enlightenment of the enlightenment , to discover a period where we fought for progress , for all these things with more force and more fronts than now .
people are growing fanatics of their belief that you can &apos;t freeze them .
it &apos;s not even going to release them .
everybody has the right to a opinion ; it really has the right to have a opinion about progress , but you know what you don &apos;t have ?
you don &apos;t have the right to your truth. i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s it .
and it took me a while to figure that out .
&quot; about 10 years ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; &quot; the new yorker &quot; &quot; ; a small article . &quot;
i was amazed to be part of impotheses , against what , after all , it &apos;s the most effective public health in the whole history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did what i usually do , i wrote an article , and i went on .
soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified food .
the same thing , only more important .
people took a war .
&quot; so i wrote an article and about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it was &quot; &quot; frankenstein food , &quot; &quot; why they thought it was changing molecules in a certain way , not in a random , meant the laws of nature . &quot;
but , as you already know , i do what i do. i wrote the article , i went on .
they &apos;re just journalists ; we &apos;re typing , arhivam , we go to dinner , everything is fine .
but these articles were disturbed me , and i didn &apos;t realize why. then i understood .
it was because those fanatics who took me out of the mind were no fanatics .
they were people with good , education , in their place .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and it got me so much . . .
but then i thought , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at the point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as far .
we talk about it ambivalent .
&quot; we &apos;re talking about it in ironic terms , and we &apos;re putting it between the guidelines : &quot; &quot; progress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what these reasons are .
we lost trust in institutions , in authority and sometimes in science .
and we have the right to do it .
you can get a few names and people will understand .
cernobyl , bhopal , challenger , rapexx , mass destruction , the wrong number of votes .
you can make your own list .
there are questions and questions about the people we think are always right .
so , be the circumspectation .
ask questions , make evidence and evidence .
don &apos;t take anything good .
but here &apos;s the idea : when you get evidence , you have to accept them. we don &apos;t really do that .
and i can tell it because we &apos;re in the middle of an epidemic of the fear of the scale of the size of the size of the world before and hopefully not to meet .
about 12 years ago , there was an article , a terrifying one , which was done between the epidemic of autism and the vaccine against the measles , the rice and rubeolei .
very frightening .
there have been countless studies to check if that &apos;s true .
they really needed to do count trials ; it &apos;s an important problem .
and the results came .
results in the united states , from the u. k . , from sweden , and all of them said the same thing : there &apos;s no correlation , no connection , none of them .
it doesn &apos;t matter. it doesn &apos;t matter , because we take serious jokes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t think a lot of documents from a government functioning that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the results were disastrous , and here &apos;s why : the united states is one of the few countries in the world where the vaccination rate against rujes is down .
that &apos;s unbelievable , we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened to us here ?
i understand , i really understand .
does anyone here look at me ?
did anybody see anybody in the audience else dying by measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen .
this country is not happening at all , but 160 , 000 times around the world last year .
a lot of deaths because of measles , 20 cases per hour .
but , because here &apos;s not what happened , we can &apos;t think about it and people like jenny mccarthy can propfy fear and ignorance using emissions like oprah and larry king .
and i can do that because i don &apos;t make the difference between causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that they seem the same thing , but they &apos;re never coined .
and we have to learn this as soon as it is .
this guy , jonas sulk , was a hero .
we got rid of one of the largest napastes of humanity .
no fear , no agony , polio disappeared .
the guy in the middle--not too much .
his name is paul offit .
and that &apos;s exactly what a vaccine developed against a rotavirus together with some other .
it saves 400 , 500 , 000 children &apos;s lives in developing countries every year .
good result , right ?
it &apos;s good , except paul talks about vaccines and how precious they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
that &apos;s how they formulate .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks to a public hearing , it can &apos;t witnesslessly not to be protected by armed fence .
it &apos;s called home because people like to tell them that i know what school goes to his children .
why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
if you remove them , the disease comes back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s right now .
in this country we have ruinedola .
it &apos;s worse and worse , and the kids will die again because of that , because it &apos;s just a statistical problem .
and they &apos;re not going to die by ruinedola .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that. why not ?
two weeks ago , a college college was written , and he said he seems like i &apos;m cam strident .
nobody told me that before .
he was not going to vaccinate his child against polio .
in no case .
all right .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio. you know what ?
yesterday , there were no polio cases in this country .
but today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy grew up in an airplane from lagos and landing on the airport in los angeles , now it &apos;s above ohio state .
it will land over two hours , it will rent a car and come to long beach and participate in one of these wonderful tedsters in this evening tonight .
he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a disease that causes paralysis , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet we live. let &apos;s not pretend that it &apos;s not like this .
we like to put ourselves in lies. we like that to crazy .
did everybody take the vitamins in the morning ?
it &apos; schinacea , slightly antioxidant to work .
i know you did that because half the u. s. population does this every day .
they take these things and they apply to alternative medicine , and they don &apos;t matter how often we find that they are completely useless .
data shows the same thing .
they make your urine more closed to color , and usually , nothing more .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for urine closed closed .
you don &apos; t .
urine closed to color. closed to color .
why do we do that ?
i think i understand--i hate big pharmaceutical producers .
we hate government. we don &apos;t trust .
and we shouldn &apos;t have. our public health system is born .
it &apos;s related to millions of people .
it &apos;s incredibly cold and distrugators of souls of people that allow us to allow us .
so we run by him. and where are we running ?
right in the arm of the great placebo .
it &apos;s fantastic. i love the great placebo .
but , in fact , it &apos;s really serious because these things are stuff of stuff and we spend on them billions of dollars .
i have here all kinds of score objects .
none of them--ginkgo , teapa , echinacea , teapa , that , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars on this , teapa .
&quot; and you know what ? when i say that , people print to me and say , &quot; &quot; what do you care ? leave people to do what they want , it makes them feel good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
&quot; because i don &apos;t care if the secretary of state in the ministry of health is the one that says , &quot; &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to consider the evidence of my mammograms looking at mammograms , &quot; &quot; or there &apos;s some sarlatan that wants to treat
when you push it on the way that faith and magic replace evidence and science , you get in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you get to thabo mbeki south africa .
it killed 400 , 000 people who insistand as red sfeclae , the landboard and the lamaie oil are much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs that we know that slow down the aids progress .
hundreds of thousands of deaths free in a devastated country more than any other disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that there is no consequences for that .
there are. there are always .
the most exciting epidemic that really stuck right now is this absurre struggle between the defense of genetically modified food and elitions of organic food .
it &apos;s a tampita controversy. it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a controversy about words , metaphors .
it &apos;s ideology , not science .
whatever i eat , every bob of rice , every four @-@ njel wire , every brussels of brussels has changed by man .
in the garden of eden , there were no mandarins .
and no yellow gallerys .
there were no christmas cheese. we did it .
i did this in the last 11 , 000 years .
some of them were okay , others don &apos; t .
i got rid of the ones that weren &apos; t .
now we can do it in a more accurate way .
of course , there are risks .
but we can put vitamin in rice , and that can help millions of people , just millions of people , taking their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say i don &apos;t understand .
we protest against genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
well , we &apos;re always hearing things like : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monogamtors , we don &apos;t want huge surfaces that one thing grow , is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
you know what my answer is all of this ?
yeah , you &apos;re right. let &apos;s fix that .
this is , we have a big problem with food , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , patent stuff .
you know science is not represented by a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process that sometimes works , and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t afford science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid is very disconnected and prevent millions of people to thrive .
over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today .
70 percent .
here &apos;s what investment have done in africa for the last 30 years .
shame. shame .
they need that , and we don &apos; t .
why ? genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat the pigs like manioc .
500 million people eat manioc .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
just calories. it &apos;s terrible .
it has no nutrition , it doesn &apos;t have proteins , and scientists put all this into it right now .
and then people will be able to eat it without blind .
they don &apos;t want hungry and you know what ?
it would be good. it wouldn &apos;t be like chez panisse , but it would be good .
all i can say is , why do we hypotheses ?
let &apos;s ask ourselves the question : why do we hypotheses ?
because we don &apos;t want to change genes ?
it &apos;s just about changing genes. not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , about insistence of having larger food , better food , particularly food .
it &apos;s not about cereal for breakfast , it &apos;s about keeping people alive and it &apos;s time to understand what that means .
because , you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do it , if we continue to wear the way we &apos;re wearing right now , we &apos;ll be guilty of something that we don &apos;t think we want to be guilty , which is high @-@ tech colonization .
we can &apos;t describe otherwise what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s under our level , and we really have to stop .
&quot; so after this incredibly funny talk , you might say , &quot; &quot; so , you still want to go into this tricky car of time to travel into the future ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
sure. of course , yeah .
now it &apos;s stuck today , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can program the car for anyway .
we can move it anywhere , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
we need to wear these conversations and we need to think , but when we go to the time , we &apos;re going forward , we &apos;ll be happy to do that .
i know that we can and after my opinion , that &apos;s exactly what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
one day the steve lopezaris at los angeles times the streets of los angeles when he heard a beautiful music .
and the source was a man , a delightful american african , necizelat , a street man , playing a violin that only had two tails .
and i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steve wrote a lot of articles that became a book , after a movie , with robert downey jr , like steve lopez , and jamie fox like nathaniel anthony ayers , with juilliard
nathaniel gave up school , it &apos;s been through a total fall , and 30 years later , without home , lived on the streets in skid row in the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to recommend you to read steve &apos;s book or see the movie to understand not just the beautiful connection that came between these two people , but also how music helped that links , and eventually it was instrumental , sorry for words , to help nathaniel don &apos;t sit on the
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concerts .
i had just heard the interpretation of the symphony and the fourth of beethoven and came behind the scenes and presented .
he was talking in a very jovial and sociable way about yo @-@ yo ma and hillary clinton , and how dodgers will never get in the final , everything because of a violin password in the last part of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
i talked about music. i got a email from steve a few days later saying nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i have to mention that nathaniel refusing to make treatment , because when he was treated with shock therapy and thorazine and catuse , and he left the cicatrici that will remain all his life .
but as a result now , it &apos;s taught to these schizophrenia episoade .
the worst of them can manifest that he &apos;s exploding , and disappearing more days , taking on the streets of skid row , exposed to those horror , with torture from the mind of disadvantaged on it .
and nathaniel was very nervous when we started our first lesson at walt disney had a kind of crazy sparked spark , was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and as someone poisoning it in sleep .
and i was afraid to me , not to me , but i was afraid i &apos;m going to lose it , that it &apos;s going to dive in one of his own states , and i &apos;m going to destroy his violin relationship if i &apos;m going to start talking about game and arpezed
so i started playing .
and i played the first part of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and as i sang , i realized that a profound change occurs in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as though it was underneath invisible drugs , a chemical reaction , which music of me was catalyst .
and nathaniel &apos;s maniacala &apos;s maniacala &apos;s manifestod in understanding , an quiet curiosity and grace .
and like in a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he started playing , after his ear , some fragments from the violin for violin that he asked me to complete , mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , andbelius .
and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven , and brahms , bruckner , all from letters b , bartok , to esa @-@ pekka salonen .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have encyclopedias about music , but he had a personal connection to music .
she was talking about her with that passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues at filarmonic in los angeles .
and as we interpret and talked to the music this man turned from a paranoid man who had just come from the streets of los angeles , in this delight , erudit , genius , educating juilliard .
music is therapy. music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is psychological health .
because music enables them to take their own thoughts and illusions , and transform them through his imagination and his creativity , in reality .
and this is an escape from his suffering .
and i realized that this is the essence of art .
this is why we do music , we take something that exists in us , essentially our fundamental emotions , and with our help of our artistic filters , with our creativity , we shape those emotions .
and the reality of that expression touches all of us , and it impresss us , inspires us and unite .
and for nathaniel , music brought him back to embrace friends .
the eliberative power of music brought it back into a family of musicians that understand it , that recognizes the talents and respect it .
i &apos;m always going to make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at walt disney , or in skid row , because it reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you. thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen without shame from cellos .
so , please forgive me .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal. i &apos;m a games designer .
i create online games 10 years already .
and my goal for the next decade is to try to make saving the world in real life as the world can save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for that , and it involves getting more people , including the present here , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
&quot; some of you might think , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot of time spent playing games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps too much time , given how many emergency issues we need to solve in the real world .
but , according to my research , at the future institute , it &apos;s exactly on the ground .
three billion hours per seven is not even far enough for games to solve the most urgent problems of the world .
in fact , i think , if we want to survive the future of centuries on this planet , we have to dramatically grow this number of hours .
we &apos;ve calculated the whole thing we need at 21 billion game every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a little bit of a counter @-@ intuitive idea .
so i &apos;m going to tell it again , i &apos;ll let it go .
if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , obesity , i think we have to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week until finele this decade. no. i &apos;m serious .
here &apos;s why. this image is able to reliefate why i think games are so essential for the future of the survival of human species .
this is a portrait done by a photographer called phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the emotion of the player .
so he set up a room in front of the players , while they were playing .
and this is a classic game emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you might lose some of the nuance of this photograph .
you &apos;ve probably noticed the need for action , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , powerful attention to drawing a very difficult problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;re going to see some amazing things like the high @-@ eyed eyes and around the mouths are signs of optimism .
and the eyebrows are a surprise sign .
this is a gamer that &apos;s near something called a epic win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that. okay. all right .
so we have some gamers among us .
a epic win is a result that &apos;s so amazing positive that you didn &apos;t think you could achieve it until you didn &apos;t win it .
it was almost beyond the limits of imagination .
and when you get there you &apos;re so shocking to discover that you &apos;re really capable. this is a epic win .
this is a player on the way to get a epic win .
and this is the girl we need to see at millions of people who solve problems around the world as we try to remove the obstacles of the century .
someone who , against the ngos , is on the way to get a epic win .
now unfortunately , this is a girl that we see more often in everyday life , as we &apos;re looking at about emergency issues .
&quot; this is what i call &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not good at living . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here i am , doing this girl. can you see ? yeah. all right .
&quot; this is me doing &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not good at living . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood .
from berkley , california , where i took my ph. d. about why we are better in games than in real life .
and this is a problem that many gamers have .
we feel that we &apos;re not as good as we are in games .
&quot; and i don &apos;t mean good as in &quot; &quot; successful , &quot; &quot; even if that &apos;s a new component we actually do in games than in real life , but when i say goodbye about doing something that matters , inspired to collaborate and cooperate . &quot;
and when we &apos;re in virtual worlds , i think many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help at some point , the most likely to focus on a problem as it is necessary , to get up after failure and try .
in real life , when we &apos;re in front of failure , when we face obstacles , we don &apos;t feel like this .
we feel depasiti .
we feel anxious , perhaps depressed , frustrated or cinici .
we &apos;ve never got that kind of feeling when we play , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i finished my university .
what is in games doing impossible to make sure that there &apos;s nothing that we can &apos;t do ?
how can we take these feelings of games and apply them to real life work ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is really a collaboration environmental for solving problems .
and i started to notice a few things that make epic gains so plausible in online worlds .
so the first thing is , whenever you go into one of these online games in world of warcraft , you meet a lot , many characters that are willing to trust a mission that would save the world immediately .
but not any mission , but a perfect mission with your current level in the game. right ?
so , you can go to the fulfilling .
i &apos;ll never give you an attempt you can &apos;t do .
but this is at the limit of what you can do. so you have to strive enough .
but there &apos;s no sleep in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no state of degeaba and losing the time .
there &apos;s always something clear and important to do .
and also , there are tons of collaborators .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to take your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that is possible in real life , this feeling that at your degae are tons of collaborators .
and in addition , it &apos;s also this epic story , this kind of inspirational story about why we are there and what we do .
and then the first thing about this positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about growth and plus one to power , plus one to intelligence .
we don &apos;t get this kind of feedback in real life .
when i go to this stage , i &apos;m not going to have plus one to spoken and plus one to a trawler ideas , plus plus 20 to ideas .
i don &apos;t get these feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaboration environments like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfaction to be on the point of earning something epic all the time that we decide to spend all the time in these virtual worlds .
it &apos;s just better than that .
so far , all of the world &apos;s world @-@ warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of today .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it could sound like a bad thing .
but let me put this in context : 5.93 million years ago , it was the moment that our first human ancestors sat in .
that was the first primate that sat in the feet .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we invest in playing games , the only way that it makes sense to think about it , is to talk about time to the magnitude of human evolution , which is an amazing thing .
but it &apos;s also appropriate. because it turns out that by spending so much time playing games , we actually change what we are capable of doing as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to a more collaborative and more heart .
that &apos;s true. that &apos;s what i think .
so , you take this interesting statistical statistics .
it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university .
the media of young people in this day today in a country with a powerful game culture will have spent 10 , 000 hours playing games online by age 21 .
now , 10 , 000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states 10.080 hours is exactly the number of hours that you &apos;re going to spend at the fifth class , and until you get high school if you &apos;re never missing from hours .
so we have a whole parallel of education that &apos;s going on where young people are learning as much about what you need to be a good gamer about everything else in school .
and some of you may have read malcom gladwell &apos;s new book called outliers .
so , you &apos;ll have heard of his theory about success , 10 , 000 success theory .
it &apos;s based on that extraordinary research on cognitive domain that says that if we can resist 10 , 000 hours of trial , anywhere until the age of 21 , we &apos;ll be specialisted on that subject .
we &apos;ll be as good at whatever we do as the largest personality in the world .
and so , at what we &apos;re looking at now is a whole generation of young people who are specialized players .
&quot; so the big question is , &quot; &quot; what exactly become the players so good ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we had a basic human resource that &apos;s basically untouched at the device .
here are how many people now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing games online games .
these are our experts &apos; gamers .
500 million people who are pretty good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion players that are pretty good at anything is something .
if you don &apos;t already know , it &apos;s coming .
the developing game games that consume a little bit of energy and working on the basis of wireless phones instead of large tape internet so that gamers around the world mostly in india , china , brazil , they can connect online .
they estimate another billion games in the next decade .
this will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what these experts are doing .
these are the four things we &apos;ve discovered. the first is the urgent optimism .
okay. think about it as an extreme motivation .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately in front of an obstacle , combined with faith that we have a reasonable chance of success .
gamers always believed that a epic win is possible , and it always deserves to try and try , and it deserves now .
players don &apos;t sit down .
gamers are experts to ask a strong social fabric .
there &apos;s a lot of studies that show us that we like people more if we play a game with them , even if they knocked us bitterly .
and the reason is it takes a lot of confidence to play a game with somebody .
we trust that someone &apos;s going to spend their time with us , that he &apos;ll play after the same rules , they &apos;ll pretend the same purpose and they &apos;ll sit in the game to the end .
and so , playing a game with somebody actually build bonds and confidence and cooperation .
and as a result , we build more powerful social relationships .
happy productivity. i love that .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the world of warcraft &apos;s world player plays 22 hours a week , think about a part of a part of part .
it &apos;s because you know , when we play a game , we &apos;re even happier working hard , rather than when we relax or when we come out with friends .
we know we &apos;re optimized as human beings to make hard and meaningful work .
and players are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re doing the right work .
finally , meaning .
players love to be attached to missions that inspires stories on the planet scale .
so , just a little bit sad to help us see things in perspective .
so , you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki , almost 80 , 000 articles is world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft through the internet than any other subject treated in any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re growing a epic story .
they &apos;re focusing on a epic resource about world of warcraft .
okay , so we have this four superpower that is buying in one thing .
gamers are powerful individuals and hopeful .
they &apos;re people who think are individual capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they think they &apos;re able to change virtual worlds , but not real world .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
it &apos;s an economist called edward castronova .
his work is brilliant. he &apos;s studying why people invest so long and energy and money in virtual worlds .
&quot; and he says , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re witnessed at what &apos;s connecting &#93; nothing less than a mass exod to virtual worlds and online environments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
: he &apos;s a economist. so he &apos;s rational .
and he says--not like me--i am a games designer and i &apos;m exuberanta .
but he says , that actually has a clear sense because players can get more in online worlds than they can get in life .
they can have more powerful social relationships in games than in real life .
they get better fedback , and they feel more rewarded in games than in real life .
so , he says that now , it &apos;s clearly a sense for players to spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
now , i agree that this is rational , for the moment .
but it &apos;s not , in no case , a optimal situation .
we need to start doing the real world more like a game .
so , i &apos;m pulling my inspiration from something that happened 2 , 500 years ago .
these are ancient zaruri , created from the bones of a sheep. right ?
before we had extraordinary jcour must have bones bone .
and these are the first game equipment created by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the historian of grec herodot , you may know this story .
which is the history of which invented games and why .
herodot said that games , and particularly zaruri games were invented in the lydiee kingdom at a time of hunger .
apparently , it was such a hunger that the king of lydiei decided that i had to do something crazy .
people were suffering. people were fighting .
it was a extreme situation. they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to herodot , they invented the zaruri games and defined a true policy all over the kingdom .
one day , every one of them will eat .
and the next day , everybody will play .
and they &apos;re going to be so focused on the zaruri games because games are so exciting and invalfested in such a satisfying productivity that they will ignore the fact that they didn &apos;t eat .
and so on the next day , they play games , and one day after , they will eat .
and according to herodotus , they lived 18 years , surviving a hunger eating one day and playing games in the other .
now , this is exactly , i think , the way we use games today .
we use games to get rid of suffering from the real world .
we use games to run away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real world , everything that &apos;s not gratifying about our lives , and we get what we need in games .
but you don &apos;t have to go there .
this is very interesting .
according to herodot , after 18 years , hunger doesn &apos;t attract .
so the king decided that they &apos;ll play a last game of zaruri .
they divided the whole kingdom in two .
they played a zaruri game , and the winners got the opportunity to go to a epic adventure .
they will leave lydia .
and they &apos;re going to go looking for a new place to live , leaving exactly the so many people to survive with few resources that were available , and hoping to drive civilization elsewhere where they can thrive .
now , that sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently , the evidence of dna showed that eternal , who led the empire , had the same dna as the old lydiees of lydiees .
and so researchers suggested that herodot &apos;s fantastic story could be true .
and geologists found evidence about a global cool that lasted about 20 years , and that could have explained famine .
so , this crazy story could be true .
they could actually save their culture playing games playing games , get through the game for 18 years , and then be so inspired and know so much about how to do it through games that they even saved their whole civilization in this way .
okay , we can do that .
we play warcraft from 1994 .
that was the first real @-@ time strategy in the world of warcraft world. this was 16 years ago .
they played zaruri games for 18 , we played warcraft for 16 .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
now they had half the civilization that left to look for a new world .
so , from here i pull my 21 billion hours of games a week .
let &apos;s get a half of us agree to play a half an hour a day of video games until we solve real problems .
&quot; now i know you wondered , &quot; &quot; how can we solve real life problems in games ? &quot; &quot; well , this is the theme that i &apos;ve devoted my work over the last few years at the institute for the future . &quot;
we have this banner to our offices in palo alto and express our opinion about how to try to relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best scenario .
and then we want to empower people to transform this scenario .
we want to imagine epic gains and then give people the means to get these epic gains .
i want to show you very briefly three of the games that we &apos;ve done to give people the means to create epic gains in their own future .
so , that &apos;s the world without oil .
we created this game in 2007 .
this is a online game where you try to survive a oil crisis .
the oil crisis is fictiva , but we put enough content there so that you can think it &apos;s real , and live your life as if we haven &apos;t had oil anymore. so when you come to this game you &apos;re wrong , you tell where you live .
and then we transmit video news in real time sources of data that shows you exactly how much oil costs , what it &apos;s not available , how it &apos;s affected the source of food , how it &apos;s affected the shipping , if schools shut down , if they &apos;re protests .
and you have to imagine how you &apos;re living your life if all of this would be true. and then you asked you to write in a blog about this , to public films , to public pictures .
i tested this game in 2007 with 1700 players .
and i &apos;ve been watching her three years since .
and i can tell you it &apos;s an experience that turns you .
nobody wants to cheat their way of life only because it &apos;s good for the world , or because that &apos;s how we need it .
&quot; but if you include them in a epic adventure and you tell them , &quot; &quot; we will stay without oil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a story and a fantastic adventure to imbark you .
let &apos;s make sure you see how you survive .
most of our players support their habits that they &apos;ve learned in this game .
so for the game that can save the world , i decided to keep on higher , higher problems than the lack of oil .
i created a game called superstruct at the future institute .
and the premise was that a supercomigotor calculated that people have only spent 23 years on this planet .
the supercomputer is called global extinction system conscious system , of course .
i asked people to come up almost like jerry bruckheimer film .
you know the movie of jerry bruckheimer , it forms a team of dream .
you have the astronaut , the scientist , the former prisoner , and they all have something to do to make the world .
but in our game , instead of having only five people in this dream team , i said all of you are part of the team of dream and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of security .
i had a lot of people who played this game for eight weeks .
&quot; they invented 500 creative solutions that you can see if you go online and look for &quot; &quot; superstruct &quot; &quot; on google . &quot;
so finally , the last game is launching it into march. this is a play created in collaboration with the global banking institute if you can complete the game you &apos;ll be certificateed by world bank institute as a social innovation , 2010 .
working with universities from all sub @-@ saharan africa and they invite them to learn social innovation techniques .
we have a graphic novel. we have growth at attributes like the local intuition , the social socialization , the cause of support , vision and capacity to be filled with resources .
i &apos;d like to invite you all of you to share this game with young people anywhere in the world , especially in developing areas that could benefit from meeting to try to start to imagine their own social companies that would save the world .
so , now i &apos;m going to summarize .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going to happen beyond ?
we have all these amazing players , we have these games that are sort of a pilot versions of what we could do , but none of these has rescued the world yet .
well i hope you &apos;ll agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use to work for real world , that games are a strong platform .
we all have these amazing superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to get a solid canvas of social relations , this feeling of urgent optimism , and desire to have a epic sense .
i hope from the soul that we can unique to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and it &apos;s my hope that you &apos;re going to join and play games like this .
when i think about the next decade , i know two things that we can create anything we can imagine and we can play any games we want .
so , i say , to start games that changes the world .
thank you .
&quot; for some time , i &apos;m interested in the placebo effect , which would seem strange to a magician , just if you think about it as i think , which is , &quot; &quot; something fake thought about countries by someone becomes real thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other words , the sugar pills have a measured effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person believes that what &apos;s going on is a pharmaceutical or something similar . . .
for pain , for example , if it &apos;s thought to the country , in the body , there &apos;s a measured effect called the placebo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of how somebody perceive it .
to understand us , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary trick , a very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works. this is a trick that you find in every magie book for kids since 1950 .
and i learned from cube magiccout in 1970 .
i &apos;ll show it , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
knife , which you can examine ; my hand , you can see it .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife like this .
i &apos;ll pull you up .
and to make sure there &apos;s nothing i &apos;m going to enter or comes out of my slums here .
so you can see that nothing goes on here .
as long as i &apos;m holding there , i &apos;m not going to go into it , and there &apos;s nothing out of my slaughter .
and it &apos;s pretty simple .
i &apos;m going to open your hand , and i hope , if it &apos;s going well , my magnetism &apos;s animal will simply support the knife .
it &apos;s actually so well stupid that they can shake their hand , and the knife doesn &apos;t fall .
it doesn &apos;t go wrong to or out of your slaughter , no complete. and you can examine everything .
ta @-@ da !
i often teach kids this trick on the magic , because you can learn a lot about the pacaleli studying whether it &apos;s very simple to do .
many of you here know it already .
here &apos;s what happens .
hold the knife in your hand .
and i say i &apos;m going to hold my hand to make sure that there &apos;s nothing there , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding for you is actually the secret of this illusion .
when my hand is moving from your face and you don &apos;t see it , this finger , the araer will move from where it is to a position like that .
hi .
there &apos;s a child with no childhood .
so , this is how it works like this .
and as i rotate , my finger is moving his position .
and we can discuss why it &apos;s going to induce that into the error , why don &apos;t you notice that there are only three fingers here , because the mind , and the way that it processs information , not count , one , two , three fingers. it &apos;s called them .
but that &apos;s not everything. isn &apos;t it ? and then open your hand .
obviously the knife is holding there , not through magnetism , but through a trick , it &apos;s holding it to me .
and then when i close the slide , the same thing , as i retreat , the motion covered in a kind of retbbing my finger .
i &apos;m eating my hand. and knife .
this trick you can make friends and neighbors. walking .
now , what about the placebo effect ?
i read a study with a year ago , which opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a scientist , so for me that was something amazing .
it turns out that if you manage a placebo pill form of a white pill , just a white pill , just a white pill , has a certain measured effect .
but if you change the shape where you give it a little bit smaller pill , you make it blue and left on it a letter , it has a greater measured effect .
although none of these pills have pharmaceuticals--they &apos;re sugar pills .
but the blue pill is not as good as the blue one .
how ? that left me a mask .
and yet it turns out it doesn &apos;t stop there .
if you take the capsules , they &apos;re more effective than the tablets , any form .
a colored sheet , yellow capsula in one end and red at the other is better than the white capsule .
and dozaj is a thing .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three--don &apos;t remember the study now. sorry .
but the idea is like--
--and dozaj matters .
and even the shape has something to do with that .
and if you want the hardest placebo , you need to go to the needle .
yeah ? a syringe with something inert--some cubic centimeters of something inert , and you inject this in a patient . . .
so it &apos;s such a powerful image for them , much stronger than the white pill .
it &apos;s real , this chart , well , i &apos;m going to show you another time i &apos;ll have slides .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue is not as good as a capsule , and it &apos;s not as good as a needle .
and there &apos;s no real pharmaceutical quality .
it &apos;s just our confidence to do it in our body and produce more powerful effect .
and i wanted to see if i could apply this to a magic trick .
and let me take something that &apos;s obviously a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study that if you want reality , you have to use the needle .
this is a seven @-@ toly hat. it &apos;s very sharp .
and i &apos;ll delete it a little bit .
that &apos;s my hand. there &apos;s nothing artificial .
this is my skin. there &apos;s no special hollywood effect .
i &apos;m going to shake my skin , and i &apos;m going to start with this needle .
if you &apos;re sensitive--if you &apos;re horrified--i was doing this for a few friends in the hotel room , and there were some people i don &apos;t know , and a woman near lesinating .
so , i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re quickly going to look at you elsewhere in the next few minutes--in fact , you know what , i &apos;m not going to do the first part of view .
you &apos;ll see , you &apos;re going to look elsewhere if you will .
so , this is , right here , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m going to make a little hole .
i &apos;m sorry .
and now i get the needle through the skin , and i &apos;m going to take it on the other side like this .
now , we &apos;re pretty much at the same point as the knife trick .
that &apos;s something like that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
well let me show you. look one , two , three , four , five .
yeah , all right .
i know what people think when they see this .
&quot; i say , &quot; &quot; well , it &apos;s not so bad that it &apos;s going to be happy to enjoy us a few minutes , &quot; &quot; well , look a little bit . &quot;
what does this look like ? pretty good .
&quot; yeah , i know. and those of you in the back will say , &quot; &quot; okay. i actually didn &apos;t see that , &quot; &quot; those in the room right next to now . &quot;
let me show you better .
this is really my skin. there &apos;s no special effect from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can laugh it .
sorry. if you go wrong , look elsewhere , don &apos;t look at that .
&quot; those of you in the back or those of you who are going to look over years on the video will say , &quot; &quot; e , okay , it looks pretty clean is a thing there , but if it were real , it should--if it &apos;s got a hole there , if it &apos;s real
ready , here we go .
normally , now i would take the needle .
i would shake my hand , and i would like to show you i didn &apos;t have any wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something false and turned it into something real , i &apos;ll leave it there , and i &apos;ll leave it off the stage .
we see ourselves a few times these days .
i hope you would expect. thank you very much .
so i met a lot of fish in my life .
i loved just two .
the first one was more like a passionate business .
it was a beautiful fish , full of taste , texture , cardboard , a star of the menu .
what fish .
even better , it was raised to a farm in , it turns out , the highest standard of sustainability .
so you could feel good when you sell it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty on the duration of many months .
one day , the director of the company called me and asked me if i was talking about a event about sustainable sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , &quot; &quot; i said . &quot;
here &apos;s a company trying to solve what has become this unimaginable problem for our boss kitchen .
how do we keep the fish on our menus ?
for the last 50 years , i fishing in sea and oceans as i deforested the forests .
it &apos;s hard to overestimate destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the one we love , the tone , the halibut , the somon , the sabie fish , they all collapsed .
they almost disappeared .
so , for good or at the river , the fish farms , become part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of controversy about acvaculture .
the farms across pollution , at least most of them do , and they have reduced productivity , you see the tone .
a major deficiency .
the tone has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one conversie rate .
what that means is it needs 15 pounds of wildlife to get a delivery of tuna growing on the farm .
it &apos;s not too sustainable .
and also , it doesn &apos;t taste too pleasant .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it well .
i wanted to support her .
on the day before the event i called the chief of public relations in the company .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; don , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; just to put things at the point , you &apos;re news because you &apos;re growing fish so far apart , you don &apos;t pollinate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; right , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re so far away that the waste from our fish are diluate , they &apos;re not focused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then he added , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re actually a new world . &quot;
&quot; food &apos;s consent rate ? 2.5 to one , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the best in the market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 2.5 to one ? what is food doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; great , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve done. i &apos;ve done the auction . &quot;
and that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called it don .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; don , give me some sustainable protein examples , &quot; &quot; he said he didn &apos;t know. i &apos;ll ask you . &quot;
well , i spoke to the phone with a few people in the company .
none of them could give me a clear response .
finally , i spoke to the chief biologist .
let &apos;s call him el don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; don , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; give me some sustainable protein examples , &quot; &quot; well , he mentioned some algae and something famous fish , and then he said the chickens . &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; chickens ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; yeah , the pene , the skin , the famous bone , resturi , dry and processed in food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; what percentage of your food is chicken ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thinking , you know , about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable in feeding your cave with chicken ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a long break on the line , and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m just too many chicks in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my love for this fish was wrong .
no , not because i would be a particularly virtuous mouth and ipocrit .
in fact , i &apos;m actually .
no , i felt wrong by this fish because , around god , after that conversation , the fish had tasted .
second fish , it &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the kind of romantic , the kind of in which , the better you know the fish , the more you love it .
you know , i eat him at a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist friend spoke for a long time about this fish .
and in a way , it showed us the meeting .
it came to the table in a white , bright black , almost sclipitoation .
the head kitchen has cooking too much .
about twice .
surprisingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish to have good taste after it was cooking too much ?
i can &apos; t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel .
in fact , his name is actually miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not the head chef .
at least not how you and i understand that .
he &apos;s a biologist at the palm .
it &apos;s a cat farm in the southwest corner of spain .
it &apos;s at the age of the guadalquivir .
by the 1980s , the 1980s was in the hands of argentinieans .
they were growing cattle in the area that was actually a swamp .
they created it through the dread of the land .
they built this series of complicated channels , and they pushed water outside the areas back to the river .
but they couldn &apos;t do it economic work .
and ecological was a disaster .
he killed 90 percent of the birds , which for this place meant a lot of birds .
so in 1982 , a spanish company with ecological consciousness bought the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the meaning of water .
they switch to their own .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to bring water back .
they flooded the channels .
they created a cat farm by 11000 hectares--biban , babusc , shrimp , print--and in this process miguel and his company , completely deleted the effects of eco @-@ friendly destruction .
farm is incredible .
i mean you haven &apos;t seen anything like that .
you holbe to the horizon that &apos;s at millions of miles away , and everything you see are flooding and swampy earth , often rich .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
he &apos;s a great guy , three parts of charles darwin and some dundee crocodile .
okay ? so here &apos;s where it &apos;s hard to go through the swamp , and i &apos;m measurable and transpir , i have mush up to knees , and miguel is holding their biology lesson .
here &apos;s a black shadow here .
now they mention mineral needs of fitoplanctoon .
and here he sees a pattern in groups that reminded his tanzanian giraffe .
we found miguel spent most of the career in the middle of the honey national park in africa .
i asked him how to become an expert in fish .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there &apos;s more discussions about rare birds and algae and strange water plant .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , you know , kind of a biological community .
it was great , but i was lovely .
and i was lesinated after that piece of fish over delicious , ready too much , which i consumed at the previous night .
&quot; so i interrupted it. i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , what makes your fish be so loud ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he showed up to algae .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yeah , i know , filfizonule , algae , fitoplancton , relationships , is amazing . &quot;
but what do you eat your fish ?
&quot; what is the consent rate of feeding ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , it started telling me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish eats what would eat and salbatacie .
plant biomass , fitoplankton , zooplankton , that feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it completely reinventing itself .
it &apos;s not necessary for another food .
have you ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
&quot; later on that day , i was driving the car through this property of migration , and i said , &quot; &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; &quot; unlike any other farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; &quot; how do you measure your success ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that point , it was like the filmmaker of a film would have asked to change the difference .
and i got the corner , and i saw the most amazing view , thousands and thousands of flamingo pink birds , a real pink covor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is success , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; look at their pink burties . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s ospatetes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ospat ? i was completely undesirable .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , but they don &apos;t ospatete from your fish ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and the icrele fish because of birds . &quot;
well , last year , this property had 6 , 000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
&quot; today has become the biggest and one of the most important sanctuary of birds in all europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , is there a population of birds &apos; population is not the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he &apos;s crazy his head , no .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re growing the fish , not intensive fish . &quot;
this is an ecological network .
flamingo birds eat the shrimp .
shrimp eats fitoplancton .
&quot; so the more pink , the better the system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all right , let &apos;s recapitulate .
a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , and a farm that measures their success through their own dust animals .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , by the way , those flamingo birds shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they &apos;re growing in a 240 kilometers away , where the soil conditions are better at building their nests .
every morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
and every night , they fly 240 kilometers back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to track the blue line of the fourth2 sauce .
it &apos;s not a joke .
i would imagine something like penguin march , so i looked at miguel .
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; miguel , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm , and then they fly 240 kilometers back at night ? &quot;
&quot; they do it for their chickens ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted from a song of whitney houston .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; no. i do it because food is better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my iubit fish , who was delicious , and i don &apos;t like my fish skin .
i don &apos;t like cake. i don &apos;t like crunch .
it &apos;s got that unpleasant taste like a gudron .
when i cook , i &apos;m going to get it almost every time .
however , when i &apos;ve tasted it to that restaurant in southern spain , it didn &apos;t have any fish leather .
he had a sweet and clean taste as if you had taken an ocean fly .
i mentioned this to miguel and he lean .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; the skin acts as a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the last defense in everything that goes into the body .
&quot; it evolved to absorb their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and then he added , &quot; &quot; but our water has no bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all right. a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish .
a farm that measures its success through the success of their own prey .
and then i understood when he said , a farm that doesn &apos;t have immortality , he has a lot of stuff , because the water that flows through the farm comes from the guadalquivir river .
it &apos;s a river that brings up all the things that rivers tend to bring in these days , chemical impurities , fish spawn .
and when he &apos;s making his way through the system and he leaves it , the water is cleaner than at the entry .
the system is so healthy that it wore water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success through your own threshold animals , but a farm that &apos;s really a use of water pursuing , not just for those fish , but also for you and also for me .
because when water goes around , she came back to the atlantic ocean .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m looking at it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story of love , though romantic , is also instructive .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , regardless of biban or cattle .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , one in which food has good taste .
but for a lot of people this is a little bit too radical .
new mouths are not realistic .
we &apos;re lovely .
we love farmers &apos; markets .
we love small farms .
we &apos;re talking about local food .
we eat organic .
&quot; and when you suggest that these are things that will provide the future of good food , somebody somewhere lifts up and says , &quot; &quot; hey man , and i love the flamingo pink birds , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
&quot; how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we already produce more calories than it takes for the world .
one billion people are going to be flake today .
a billion--that &apos;s more than ever before--because of great inequalities in distribution , not because of quantity .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it led the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
&quot; feed the grasslands with the border , treating the monopolys with pesticides , put chemicals into the soil , and all of the agrarian ask the whole question , &quot; &quot; how bad can we be if we feed more people with less money ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the motivation .
it was justification .
it was the plan of american agriculture business .
we should say it , a liquid business , a business that erodess the ecological capital that makes that production possible .
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our bread basket is threatened today not because of the declines in the decline , not by the invention of the last tractor or the silence , but the lack of the fertilizer , not pumping water , not the lack of fresh water , not the lack of the chains , but the lack of forests ,
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s say , how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural business model in the future .
it &apos;s very old , and it &apos;s periphery .
they consume a lot of capital , chemistry and cars , and never produced something good to eat .
instead of looking at the eco @-@ model .
this is the one that is based on billions of years of experience at workplace .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel , farms that aren &apos;t fighting for themselves , farms that restore , farms that are growing extensive instead of just intensive , farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships , because they are those who are experts in tastes .
and if i really wanted to be honest , they &apos;re better kitchens than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , i &apos;m walking with this , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , she &apos;ll be delicious .
thank you .
i grew up with a constant science fiction diet .
at high school , i was walking with the bus at school a city and come back every day .
and i was always absorbed by a book , a fantastic scientific book , who was wearing my mind to other worlds and satisfy me in a narrative form , this sense of curiosity that i had .
&quot; and you know--that curiosity also manifests in the fact that whenever i was at school , i was out , by the forests , walking around and walking &quot; &quot; samples , &quot; &quot; frogs and snakes and cockroaches and heletations water , and i brought them back ,
i was a really nerds in science .
but it all had to do with my attempt to understand the world , to understand the limits of possible .
and my passion for scientific science--fantastic seemed to be found in the world around me , because of what &apos;s going on--this was going on in the late 60s--i was going to go to the moon , we explore the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came to our living room with amazing emission that showed us animals and places from a fantastic world that we couldn &apos;t imagined before .
so , this seemed to be resonated with all of the scientific scientific--fantastic .
and i was an artist .
i could draw. i could paint .
and i discovered that because there were no video games , and this cg movies , and all of this picture of images in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all had to , as kids have to read a book , and through the description of the author , put something on the cinema screen from the launtlogy of our heads .
and so my answer to all of this was to draw , paint creatures and alien worlds , robots , spacecraft , all of these things .
i was always caught at the mathematics of doodling on the dog .
that &apos;s because this is because this creativity had to find themselves , somehow , a way of getting out .
and it was an interesting thing , jacques cousteau &apos;s shows me very excited about that there was a alien , alien , right here on earth .
i could not really go into a alien world in a space ship ever .
this dream seemed pretty unbelievable .
but that was a world where i could really go , right here on earth , and this was as rich and exotic as anything i imagined reading those books .
so i decided i would become a dive at age 15 .
and the only problem with this was that we were living in a little satuc in canada , 600 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that intimidated me .
i slept my father until he found , finally , a short classroom class in buffalo , new york city , just near the border , almost where we were living .
and i actually became a dividing dive in a small pool in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
and we didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean for another two years , when we moved to california .
since then , over the course of 40 , i spent about 3 , 000 hours underwater and 500 of those hours were in submarine .
and we learned that that deep deep environment , and even less deep oceans are so full of life , that it &apos;s really beyond what we can imagine .
nature imagination is so quiet , compared to ourselves , poor human imagination .
i &apos;m totally amazed by what i see when i do these dives .
and my love story with the continuing ocean , and it &apos;s as strong as it was always .
but when i picked a career , as an adult , that was the film .
and this seemed to be the best way to reconcile this need that i had to tell stories with the need to create images .
and as a child , we &apos;re constantly drawing comicss , and so on .
so , the creation of films was the way to put images and stories together. and that made sense .
&quot; and of course , the stories i chose to say were scientific science--fantastic stories : &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; abisul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and with &quot; &quot; the slaughter , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve got my love for underwater landscape and dive with film creatures . &quot;
by combining these two passions .
&quot; there &apos;s something interesting about &quot; &quot; abisul , &quot; &quot; which is solving a narrative narative problem that film , which is creating this liquid being in the water , for which i hug embraced the computer , cg . &quot;
and this led to the first character that ever appeared in a movie .
and even though the movie didn &apos;t make money , i should say that she had just won the investment , i was witnessed to something great , which is that the audience , the global audience , was hypnotized by this magic .
you know , it &apos;s arthur clarke &apos;s law that any advanced technology is impossible to be made of magic .
they saw something magic .
and so , that made me become very excited .
&quot; and i thought , &quot; &quot; wow , that &apos;s something that needs to be adopted in art cinematografica . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why , in &quot; &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; &quot; which was my next movie , i took this a lot further . &quot;
working with ilm , we created the lichid metal in that movie , the success depends on how this special effect would work .
and it worked. and we created magic again .
and we had the same result with the audience .
i did a little bit more money on this .
so by pulling a line between these two experiences , it &apos;s kind of a new world , a new form of creativity for film artists .
in conclusion , i put a company with stan winston , my good stan winston friend , which is creative designers and costume at that time , and i called it a digital domain .
and the idea behind the company was that we &apos;re going to jump over the analogic processes of optics and so on and so forth , we &apos;ll go straight into digital production .
and we did that , which gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but i went back to the late &apos; 90s in terms of design of creation and characters , which was actually the company that company had been given .
&quot; and i wrote this piece called &quot; &quot; avatar &quot; &quot; who had the role of pushing things beyond visual effects , computer effects on the computer and more , with human characters of emotion , generate in cg . &quot;
and the main character was going to be completely generated in cg .
and the world was going to be all cg .
but plans didn &apos;t work .
and people at my company told me that we couldn &apos;t do that for a while .
so , i put the idea of the pastration , and i did another film about a big boat going down .
&quot; you know , i went and presented it to the studio as &quot; &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was going to be a romantic story of epic proportion , a passion .
in secret , what i wanted to do was to dive me down to research the real epava of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why we did the movie .
this is the truth. well , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
&quot; but i convinced them. i said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to dive out. we &apos;ll filmed it on good . &quot;
we &apos;re going to use this at the beginning of the movie .
&quot; it &apos;s going to be very important. it &apos;s going to be a great deal of marketing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy. but it has to do with that subject that your imagination can create a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i found myself in a russian submarin two and a half under the level of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a hublou , not a movie , not hd , right .
now , that fascinated me .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things like this , but it struck me how much this dive , this deep dive was similar to a space mission .
you know , where everything was strong technological , and that was extremely planning .
you go into this capsule , you lean into this dark and hostile environment where there is no hope to be saved if you can &apos;t go back to yourself .
&quot; and i thought , &quot; &quot; wow. i was living in a fantastic scientific film . &quot;
&quot; this is indeed cool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so i was really beaten by the mania exploration of the oceans .
of course , by curiosity , by the scientific thing .
it was everything. it was adventure , it was curiosity. it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , and i could create a visual effect for her. but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing through that hublou .
while i was doing some of the external expeditions , i would see creatures at hydrothermal ventilators and sometimes things that i never saw before , sometimes things that no one ever saw before , which weren &apos;t described by science at the time we see and photographed them .
so , i was completely trying to do this , and i had to have more .
so i took a pretty curious decision .
&quot; after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to put a break of hollywood producer--ian de videos and i &apos;m going to become a whole time explorer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we started to plan these expeditions .
and we ended up going to bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the titanic .
i took little robots that i had created has am bobinat fibra optic .
and the idea was to go inside and make a interior exploration of ships , which hasn &apos;t done before .
no one looked inside the epration. they didn &apos;t have the means to do this , so we created technology to do this .
so , you know , i &apos;m on the deck of the titanic , in a submarine and looking at the floor that looked a lot like the ones i knew that he was playing the orchestra .
and i &apos;m controlling a little robotic vehicle through the ships .
when i say , i control it , but my mind is in that vehicle .
i felt like i was physically physically present inside the titanic age .
and it was the most jerusalem in common already vu experience that i ever had , because i knew before i went through a corner of what &apos;s going to be there before the lights of the vehicle to reveal it , because i was walking around the stage months when we create the movie .
and the stage was built as an exact replica of the boat plan .
this was a remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize the telepresence that you can have with these robotics avatars , when your consciousness is injected in a vehicle , in this form of existence .
it was a profound thing .
and maybe a quick look at what might happen over a few decades , as we &apos;re going to start having cyborg body for exploration or for other goals in many of the kinds of post @-@ human futures that i can imagine that the fan of science fiction .
so by doing these expeditions and starting to appreciate what we &apos;ve discovered there , down , like these income zones in the deep ocean , where we discovered these amazing animals .
they &apos;re essentially aliens that live right here on earth .
they live in a chemical synthesis environment , they don &apos;t survive in a solar light system , so we .
so you see animals living next to water jets with 500 degrees .
you think it could not survive .
at the same time , i was very interested in the science of space , again , the scientific influence--the fantastic i &apos;ve experienced at the time of childhood .
and i found myself involved in the community of interest in nasa , by doing some of the nasa consultant council , plans on real space missions , going to russia , going through the biomedical protocols for pre @-@ cosmonauti and all these things , to really go and fly to the international space station with
and that was fascinating .
but what i ended up doing is to bring people to the space with us in the deep .
and to drive them down because they have access , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments , taking them in the deep , and let them see and get samples to test instruments , and so on .
so here we are doing documentaries , but we actually look at , we create space science .
i completely closed the circle of being a scientist--fantastic , you know , as a kid , and doing these things on good .
i learned a lot about science. but i also learned a lot about art to drive .
now , you would think that the region has to be a leader , the leader , the captain , and all of these things .
i really didn &apos;t really learn about art to drive until i did these expeditions .
&quot; because i had to , at some point , say , &quot; &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
&quot; why do i do that ? what do you win from that ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t make money with these non @-@ missions .
we just survive. they don &apos;t bring any kind of fame .
&quot; people kind of think i &apos;ve left between &quot; &quot; titanic &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; avatar &quot; &quot; and i was doing my fingertips somewhere sitting at the beach . &quot;
we did all these films , we did all these documents for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money. what do you do ?
you do it for the work itself , for the challenge--and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exist , for the emotion of discoveries and the strange connection that form when a small group of people form a tight team .
because we were doing these things with a 10 @-@ 12 team , working for years .
sometimes it &apos;s two to three months old .
and in this connection , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have for them and they have for you , that you did a job you can &apos;t explain someone else .
&quot; when you go back to the shoreline and you say , &quot; &quot; we had to do this , and fiber optics , and atenuation , all the technology that has been involved , and the difficulty of human performance to work on the sea , you can &apos;t explain people. it &apos;s that thing that
it creates a connection , it creates a respect connection .
&quot; so , when i went back to doing my next movie , which was &quot; &quot; avatar , &quot; &quot; i tried to apply the same principle to drive , which is to respect your team and win them at the same time and their respect . &quot;
and it really changed dynamic .
&quot; and here i am again with a small team , the unknown territory , doing &quot; &quot; avatar , &quot; &quot; invent new technology , who don &apos;t exist until . &quot;
amazingly interesting .
great challenging .
and i became a family , over a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year period .
and that changed all my way to make films .
so people have comenced the way , well , you know , brought to life of oceanic organisms and put them on the pandora planet .
for me it was more fundamental to do business , the process itself , that changed as a result of this .
so , what can we synthesize from that ?
you know , what are lessons learn ?
well , i think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a force that can really manifest in reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than everybody in the world .
&quot; the young makers of films come to me and say , &quot; &quot; give me a advice to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and i tell them , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t limit yourself . &quot;
other people will do that for you , don &apos;t do it alone , don &apos;t bet against you .
&quot; and take risks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nasa has this favorite phrase : &quot; &quot; failure is not an option . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a trust issue .
and no important trial that asked innovation has not done without risk .
you have to be willing to drop those risks .
so , this is the thought that i leave you with , that in whatever you do , failure is an option , but fear , no. thank you .
i would like to leave you with one important idea today , which is that the whole amount of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about overlapping with information i would rather think about how we can use information so that we can see patterns and see the trends that
now we &apos;re looking at the ordinary mortality graph organized after the age .
the program i use here is experimental , it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with it is i can filter a certain cause of death , accidents for example .
immediately , i see another structure , differently .
because , here in the middle , people are in their most active period , and this is because they become very fragile .
we &apos;re doing a step back and we &apos;re showing the data after death , and we see that the disease of circulatory and cancer are the tough suspects , but not for all .
if we continue and filtram after age , let &apos;s say 40 years or less , we see accidents are actually the most common cause to worry about people .
and further , it &apos;s particularly the case for men .
you realize that this kind of visualization of data , it &apos;s like swimming in a graphic graphic graph .
and if we can do this with simple data , why don &apos;t we do the same with the content ?
here &apos;s the cover of every number in sports illustrated that has been printed before .
they &apos;re all here. they &apos;re all on the internet .
you can try this home when you go from here .
with pivot , you can look at certain periods .
then some years .
you can go directly to a particular subject .
i look at this--i see athletes that came up in this sport editie .
i &apos;m a great fan lance armstrong , so i select it , and that brings me all the numbers where lance armstrong appeared .
&quot; if i just wanted to look at them , maybe i &apos;m going to go through my mind , &quot; &quot; what would i be to see what they &apos;re going to see about ciclism generally ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
i go back and open this .
i see greg lemond now .
and you understand that when you navigate through information in this way , when you &apos;re more generally , you go back and forth , don &apos;t look , you don &apos;t navigate .
you do something a little bit different .
it &apos;s somewhere in the middle , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
i want to go a little bit further on this idea that &apos;s a little bit of a sonat .
i took every page in wikipedia and reduced it to a summarized .
the sum is just a short description and an iconet that indicates the field of which comes from .
i &apos;m just showing you the first 500 most popular pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
we immediately see what the main most popular subjects are on wikipedia .
now i &apos;m going to select governance .
now that i chose government , i can see the category in wikipedia that correspond to the most frequently , which is time magazine--the personality of the year .
and that &apos;s important because it &apos;s something that was not content in no wikipedia page .
you can find that only if you do a step back and look at all at all simultaneously .
looking at all these particular summaries , i can then explore the concept of time magazine--the personality of year , bring them all over the surface .
and i look at these people , i see most of them come from government .
a few come from natural sciences .
a few , fewer , comes from business .
this is my boss .
and that comes from music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted winner .
so we &apos;re going to look at the ted winner .
you see , we first navigate the web as though it really would be a network , not from the page in the page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and i want to show you one thing that can take you through surprise .
i &apos;m showing you the new york times site .
pivot , our application--i don &apos;t want to call it browser , because it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see web pages with it--and we use marire and small technology in every page .
i can step back , go back to a certain section .
why is important , because just accessing web pages in this way , i can see my whole search history in exactly the same way .
i can explore more in detail what i did in different times .
here &apos;s the situation of this demo we &apos;re doing now .
and i can look at the stuff i &apos;ve done today earlier .
and if i want to step back and look at all i can disecfy my search history , for example .
here i looked for bing , here for live labs pivot .
and from here i can choose a page and launch it again .
it &apos;s a reusable metaphor many times , and every case makes the whole larger than the sum of the parts in the data .
now , in our world , we think data is a curse for us .
we &apos;re complaining about the over @-@ over @-@ over @-@ information curse .
we say we suffocate our data .
what if we came back to the other way back and come back and the web , so instead of going from one thing to the next , we used to go from more to more things , and be able to find patterns that otherwise are hidden ?
if we did that , instead of getting trapped into data traps , we could actually be able to extract information .
and instead of having a primary relationship with information , we could actually extract knowledge .
and if we extract knowledge , maybe it &apos;s also wisdom .
with that , thank you .
everybody talks about happiness today .
&quot; i asked someone to count how many books that have the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in title have been published over the last five years and quit about 40. there &apos;s a lot more . &quot;
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of counselor for finding happiness .
everyone wants to make people happier .
but despite numerous activities in this area , there are some cognitive trap that prevents us to make a clear picture of happiness .
my talk today &apos;s talk is going to be able to read in these cognitive traps .
they &apos;re so true to ordinary people who think about their happiness and researchers studying the concept of happiness , apparently we &apos;re as confused as everyone else .
the first of these heads is the reticent to admit the complexity of happiness .
&quot; it turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is no longer a word because we use it too many different things . &quot;
there &apos;s probably a specific sense that we could restrange , but generally , we &apos;re going to have to give up this notion and adopt a more common vision of goodness .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : in fact , a confusion between being happy in life and satisfied in his own life or satisfied about his life .
there are two very different concepts , both in the notion of happiness .
and the third confusion is the illusion of perception , the fact that we can &apos;t think of no circumstances that affect the well @-@ being without distorted the importance .
and this is a serious cognitive trap .
we just don &apos;t perceive it .
i &apos;d like to start with an example of a person who &apos;s in a question of questions and answers at the end of my seminar told a random story .
he said listening to a symphony and that music had been absolutely great .
but at the end of the recording , there &apos;s been a terrible scary , and he added , quite affected , that the scartait had broke the whole experience .
it &apos;s actually not experiencing the experience , but the memory of experience .
he &apos;s living experience .
it &apos;s about 20 minutes of wonderful music .
but they were reduced to zero because what was left was memory .
the memory had been altered , and the memory was all left .
the conclusion here is that we probably perepete ourselves as entities with double self .
there &apos;s a self at the real time that remains in the present , and lives the present , capable of retreating the past , but basically it &apos;s just the present .
it &apos;s the self to talk about the doctor .
&quot; you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; &quot; hurt when do you appear here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , there &apos;s memory self , and memory self is the one that keeps driving and maintain the memory of our lives .
&quot; it &apos;s the one who asks the doctor when they ask , &quot; &quot; how would you feel like the last time ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; or &quot; &quot; how was the trip in albania ? &quot; &quot; and so on. m. d . &quot;
these two are very different entities , self @-@ synergy and self @-@ memory self , and the confusion of them leads to ambiguity to the notion of happiness .
memory self is a storyteller .
it starts with the basic answer of our memories , it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t tell stories only when we consciously tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , more precisely , what we &apos;re able to remember from our lives is a story .
let me start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study about patients that go through a painful experience .
not in the details. it &apos;s no longer painful today , but it was painful during the study in &apos; 90s .
patients were asked to describe their pain every 60 seconds .
we have two patients here and their regulations .
&quot; the question is , &quot; &quot; what suffered more ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very simple question .
obviously the patient b suffered more .
his colonoscopy took more , has gone through every minute of pain that he went through and the patient , even more .
&quot; but here &apos;s another question , &quot; &quot; how did these patients have perceived ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here we have a surprise : the surprise is that the patient remained with a much more unpleasant memory about colonoscopy than the patient b .
the memory of these colonoscopies were different because a crucial part of the story is how it ends up .
none of those stories are memorable or grandious but one of them. but one of them is obviously more unpleasant than the other one .
and the worst was that pain was more intense to the end .
it &apos;s an unpleasant story .
how do we know ?
i asked these people after colonoscopy , much later , how unpleasant it was .
in their memory , it was much more unpleasant for the patient than for b .
it &apos;s a direct conflict , between the self and the self of memory .
from the experimental self &apos;s point of view , it &apos;s clear that the b patient suffered more .
what we could do with the patient , and we actually did clinic experiments , which worked , is to take the colonoscopy of the patient holding the tube without moving it too much .
that &apos;s going to make the patient suffer , but slightly , much less than ever before .
if we do that for about two minutes , we &apos;re doing this about the experience of the moment of the patient &apos;s moment , but we improve the self of the memory , because now we &apos;ve left the patient with a better memory of his experience .
what does a story define ?
and it &apos;s true for the stories that we provide memory , but also for the stories we invent .
which defines a story are changes , meaningful moments and end .
the end is very , very important .
in this case , the end of it was determined .
the self at times lives their content .
does it have successful moments of living , and you ask , what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is very simple .
they &apos;re lost forever .
most of the moments of life--and we calculated : psychologists present , it says it takes about three seconds .
it means that in a life , we have about 600 million moments of time .
one month we have about 600 , 000 .
most of them don &apos;t leave it .
most of them are completely ignored by memory self .
and yet , we have the impression that we should matter , that what &apos;s going on in these moments of living is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we consume during our existence on earth .
and the way we spend it should be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that memory self keeps .
so we have the self of memory and the self , which are distinct .
the biggest difference between them is the way it &apos;s processed time .
from the point of view of the self , if you go to vacation and the second week is as good as the first one , the vacation vacation is twice as good as a week .
for memory self , things don &apos;t work at all .
for the memory &apos;s self @-@ memory , a two @-@ week vacation is better than a week vacation , because we don &apos;t add new memories .
the story hasn &apos;t changed .
so time becomes essential variable that distinguishs self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ synergy .
duration has a reduced impact on the story .
the memory self doesn &apos;t only do to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that takes decisions because if a patient had , for example , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and decides to choose , the elected one will be the one whose memory is less unpleasant , because that &apos;s the thing that determines choice .
experimental self has nothing to say in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experience , but between experience memories .
and even when we think about the future , we normally don &apos;t think about the future as a set of experiences .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
and essentially , you can consider this , as a tyranny of the self of memory , and you can consider the self of memory as something that pulls up after the experimental self through the experience that experimental self doesn &apos;t need .
i feel that when we go to vacation , and that &apos;s very often happening , that &apos;s where we go to vacante , in a very big deal , in the service of memory self .
and that &apos;s kind of hard to justify , it seems to me .
i mean , how do we consume our memories ?
this is one of the things that explains the dominance of memory .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation i spent in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the most beautiful vacation i had , and i think of it quite often , as much as i think about other vacantes .
and i &apos;ve probably consumed that three @-@ week memories to say for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
if i ever had ever opened the 600 pictures , i would have spent another hour .
so , you know , on the one hand , three weeks , and on the other hand , the most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
i may be a little bit through zgarcenia that i consume my memories , but even if you eat them in a greater measure , the question remains true .
why do we give so much important memory by compared to experience ?
so , i &apos;d like to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that at your next vacation , you know that at the end of all of your photos are going to be destroyed , and you &apos;re going to take a drug that causes amnesia so that you don &apos;t remember anything .
would you pick the same holiday ?
and if you &apos;ve run another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between the experimental self and the memory self , and you &apos;ve got to think about how to transmit this conflict , and it &apos;s actually not easy at all because if you take time as criteria , you &apos;ll have an answer .
and if you take memories like criteria , you may have another answer .
why do we choose the vacuums that we choose ?
it &apos;s a problem where we face a choice between the experimental and the memory self .
the experimental self and the memory of memory are doing two different notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one for each self .
so you can ask , how happy is the experimental self ?
and on the other hand : how happy are the moments of the experimental self ?
and they &apos;re all happy at all .
it &apos;s a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now to do a pretty well @-@ contributed idea of the happiness of experimental self through time .
instead , happiness of self @-@ memory self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy life lives their lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfaction as excitement as this person when it &apos;s thinking about his life .
it &apos;s a very different notion .
who doesn &apos;t make the distinction between these notions , will compromise the study of happiness , and i belong to a group of scientists of goodness that have compromise the study of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between the happiness of the experimental self and satisfaction of the memory self has been recognized over the last few years , and they &apos;re now doing efforts to measure both separate them .
the gallup organization makes a world opinion survey where more than half a million people were asked about what they believe about their lives and their experiences .
and they were also done other effort .
so over the last few years we started learning some things about the two kinds of happiness .
and i think the main lesson i learned , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how satisfaction are with their lives , and that really doesn &apos;t really indicate a lot about how happy they are in their lives , and vice versa .
&quot; just to give you an example of correlation , correlation is about 0.5 means if you meet someone and you say , &quot; &quot; oh his father is tall than 1.80 meters , &quot; &quot; how much did you know about the height of this person ? &quot;
well , you knew something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty you have so much uncertainty .
if i told you somebody has evaluated his life on eight to 10 , you had a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with experimental self .
so correlation is small .
we know something about what it controls the satisfaction of the self of happiness .
we know money are very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means rather to be satisfied with people who like us , spend time with people who liked .
there are other pleasure , but they &apos;re too intense .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two self , you &apos;ll get to do different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is the girl that we should not think about happiness as a substitution for well @-@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t think of simplistic about happiness is that we don &apos;t mean the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask a simple question about how happy people in california are not going to get to the answer right .
when you ask this question , you would think that people have to be happier in california if , for example , you live in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that when you think about the living in california , you think of the contrast between california and other places , and the fact that this contrast is , for example , climate .
but it turns out that climate is actually not very important for the experience itself , and it &apos;s not very important for the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
however , because the reflective self is at leadership you could get--some people could get to move to california .
and it &apos;s interesting to watch what &apos;s going to happen to people that move into california hoping that they &apos;re going to be happier .
so their experimental self will not become happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen. they will think they &apos;re happier .
because when they &apos;re thinking about it , they &apos;ll remember how horrible it was in ohio , and they &apos;ll feel they &apos;ve taken good decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well @-@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve offered a picture of how difficult it is .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you. i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
a few weeks ago , when i spoke to the phone , you mentioned the fact that you got an interesting result in the gallup opinion survey .
do you think you can share that given that you still have a few minutes ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result of gallup polls is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to get .
what we &apos;ve learned about the happiness of the experimental self .
we looked at how the feelings are related to income .
and it turns out that under a 60 , 000 dollars per year , americans , and that &apos;s a great number of interogati americans , about 600 , 000 , which is a great sample , under a income of 600 , 000 dollars a year--
ca : 60 , 000 .
dk : 60 , 000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become more unfortunate , as they become poor above this level , we get a flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw such a line .
it &apos;s clear that money doesn &apos;t bring the happiness of the experimental self , but the lack of them brings unhappiness , and we can measure this very , very accurate unhappiness .
in terms of the other self , the memory self , we have to do with another situation .
the more money you have , the more you are .
this is not true in the case of emotions .
ca : but danny , all the american dream is about life , freedom , search for happiness .
if the world would take this discovery seriously , i mean , everything seems to be on everything we think , for example , fiscal politics and so on .
is there any chance that political people , as the state in general , to take such an opportunity and to elaborate politics in the public based on it ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s a recognition of the role of happiness in public politics .
the recognition will be slow in us , unindoielnic , but in the uk , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries .
people realize that they should think of happiness when they think about public politics .
it &apos;s going to take some time , and the world will debate if they want to study experimental happiness , or if they want to study the rating of life , so we have to have this debate pretty soon , because to improve happiness , there are different ways , depending on how we think , and
this is going to influence politics , i think , in the next years .
in us , they &apos;re doing experimental happiness in terms of the experimental happiness of people , i think , in the next two decades , some of the national statistics that : it turns out that this subject is going to be , or at least , the most interesting debate of watching over the years .
thank you very much for being invented behavioral economics .
thank you danny kahneman .
i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
and this may seem a little bit surprising because my entire work at the foundation is related to vaccines and seeds , of things we need to invent and deliver to help the poor two billion live better .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
climate change means that many years of crops are not going to grow .
it &apos;s going to be too much rain , it &apos;s not going to be enough rain .
things will change in ways that their fragile environment just can &apos;t fall in .
and that leads to hunger. it leads to uncertainty. it leads to nervous .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , if we could choose one thing to get them down the price to reduce poverty , we &apos;ve run away from energy .
well , the price of energy has reduced over time .
right , the advanced civilization is based on energy progress .
the coal revolution powered the industrial revolution , and right in the 1990s of the price of electricity has known a rapid decline , and that &apos;s why we have fridge , air conditioning , we can create modern materials and doing so much things .
and so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in terms of electricity in the rich world .
but once we do it cheaper--and let &apos;s try to do it twice as cheaper as we need to respect a new constraint , and this constraint has to do with co2 .
co2 heats the planet , and the equation about co2 is really quite simple .
if we collect the amount of co2 emise , this leads to a temperature growth , and the temperature rise to some very negative effects .
the effects of the time , and perhaps worse , the indirect effects so that natural ecosystem cannot adapt these fast changes , and that &apos;s how you get to the collapse of the ecosystem .
now , the exact embodiment of koreans between the rise of co2 and the rise of temperature , and where there are positive reactors , there &apos;s still some kind of uncertainty , but not very big .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how severe these effects are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely severe .
i asked people the brand scientist , on the line of rows : do we really have to get close to zero ?
can &apos;t we reduce half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that we won &apos;t get close to zero , the temperature will continue to grow .
so we have a big problem .
it &apos;s not all about a four @-@ meter truck that has to go under a three @-@ meter bridge , and that we could somehow be able to go through .
here we have something that needs to be reduced to zero .
well , we emits a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for every american is about 20 tons .
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than a ton .
on average on the planet are about five tons for every man .
and somehow , we have to make changes that go down to zero .
he grew up .
only different economic changes have produced some stability , so we have to go from a rapid growth to decrease , and down to zero .
equation has four factors .
a little bit of breeding .
so , we have something on the left , co2 , which we want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services that every person uses on average , average energy for every service and co2 on the unit of energy .
let &apos;s look at each of them and see how we can get to zero .
probably one of these numbers will have to come close enough to zero .
now , this is from high school algebra , but let &apos;s look at it .
first , we have the population .
now , the world is today 6.8 billion people .
this is about nine billion .
now , if we do a great job with new vaccines and healthcare services and reproductive health services , we might be able to decrease this with maybe 10 percent or 15 percent , but here we see a growth of about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , television , warming .
these are very good things , and it &apos;s got rid of poverty means to provide these services almost everybody on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to grow .
in the rich world , maybe in the first billion , maybe we might be able to limit and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , will increase , so generally , the services offered every person will increase twice twice .
here &apos;s a very basic service .
do you have light in your home to read your home ?
well , these kids don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their homework to light bulbs from stalpi .
and then efficiency , it &apos;s energy for every service , here &apos;s the end of something good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t grow .
through different inventions and ways of lighting , through different kinds of cars , different ways of building buildings , there are many services where you can reduce energy for that substantial service , in the case of certain services , even by 90 percent .
there are other services , for example , how do we make fertilizer or making air transportation , where there &apos;s much less place for improving .
so on average , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a three @-@ year reduction , maybe six times .
but for these three factors so far , we get from 26 billion , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor--this is going to be a key factor--which is the amount of co2 emisa on the unit of energy .
and the question is : can we actually reduce it to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way to produce electricity today , except for emerging and nuclear methods , brought co2 .
what we &apos;re going to need to do in the global scale , is to create a new system .
so , we need miracles of energy .
now , when i use the miracle term , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
microprocessor is a miracle. the personal computer is a miracle .
his internet and services are a miracle .
people here have contributed to creating many miracles .
normally we don &apos;t have a term , so you can get a miracle to once .
normally just wait and some come , not .
this is a case where we really need to accelerate at the very maximum and get a miracle in a fairly short time .
i thought , well , how could i kill the idea ?
is there any natural illustrates , about demo that could stimulate people &apos;s imagination ?
i thought last year i brought mosquitos , and it turns out that some of them loved .
it really involved in the idea that , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
well , with energy , all i could find was this .
i thought i &apos;d go through a few fireflies , and that &apos;s my contribution to the environment here in this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
i was told that i couldn &apos;t fly. i actually may not even go out of the jar .
now , there &apos;s all kinds of tricky solutions like this , but they don &apos;t know who value .
we need solutions , one or more , who have an incredible scale , and they &apos;re big confidence , and although people are looking for many directions , i see only five that can produce big numbers .
i left the energy of the sea , geotermic , fusion , biofuels .
they may be able to contribute somebody , and if they want to get my expectations , the better .
but what i want to point out here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and that we can &apos;t give up any of them even if they seem overwhelmed , because they all present significant difficulties .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels or burning coal , or natural gas .
what we &apos;ve got to do here , it &apos;s simple , but it &apos;s not , is to take the co2 , after we burned it and out of the horn , presurize it , lichefiem , put it somewhere and hopefully stay there .
now we have some pilot stuff doing this at the 60 level to 80 percent , but growth to the percentage of plenty , that &apos;s going to be very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be hard to understand where to put these amounts of co2 , but here &apos;s the hardest problem in the
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guarantee something that &apos;s literally about billion times greater than any kind of residents that you can think of , nuclear or another way ?
it &apos;s a very large volume .
it &apos;s a hard problem .
next would be nuclear power .
she &apos;s got three big problems .
cost , especially in strict regularized countries , it &apos;s big .
the problem of security , to be quiet that nothing can happen , that even though there are these human operators , the fuel will not be used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , even if there &apos;s not a lot , we &apos;re concerned about that .
people need to feel good about this .
so there are three really heavy problems that might have solutions , and so we should work on them .
the last three of the five i put them together .
these are the ones that people call renewables .
but they even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel--they have some disadvantage .
one is that energy density produced by these technologies is much lower than a power plant .
these are energy farms , we &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , a thousand times larger than a normal power plant .
these are intermittances .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , and it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t leave it all the time .
if we depend on these sources , we need a way to get energy in that period when it &apos;s not available .
here &apos;s the big problem .
we have difficulties to transport .
for example , let &apos;s say a source of energy is out of the country , you don &apos;t just need technology , you need to examine you and risk to be able to be able to go from one another .
and finally , there &apos;s the embodiment problem .
and to understand the size , we took all kinds of batteries that are produced , for cars , computers , phones , lanterne , whatever .
we compared to the amount of energy that we consume the world , and we found that all the batteries that we &apos;re producing now could emphasize less than 10 minutes from total energy .
so , in fact , we need a significant progress here , a hundred times better than what we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
this problem is when we want intermittances to be fish , say , 20 to 30 percent of consumption .
if we rely on it for 100 percent , we need a miracle battery .
well , how are we going to move on , what &apos;s the right way ?
is it a manhattan project ? what can we help us get there ?
well , we need lots of firms to work on this , hundreds .
each of these five roads , we need at least 100 people .
and many of them are going to look and say they &apos;re crazy. that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , we have a lot of people that are already on this road .
bill gross has a few companies , between which one called esolar , which has some excelente thermal solar technologies .
come on khosla invest invest in tens of companies doing remarkable things and interesting possibilities , and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i actually support a company that maybe surprisingly , follow the nuclear path .
there are some innovation in nuclear field : modularity , liquid .
but innovation really stopped in this field a long time ago , so it wouldn &apos;t be surprising to exist some good ideas somewhere .
the idea of the terrapower is that instead of throwing some of the uranium , that one percent that &apos;s u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent of u238 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
it was actually talking about it for a long time , but it was never able to simulate how if it worked or not .
it &apos;s because of modern supercomputers now can simulate and see that , indeed , using the right materials , it turns out it would work .
and because the 99 percent is burned , the cost profile is much improved .
we actually burn the waste , and we can use fuel all the waste remains from today &apos;s reactors .
instead of worrying for them , we use them. it &apos;s a great thing .
inspired the uranium as it goes forward. it &apos;s like a candle .
&quot; here &apos;s a kind of bustean , called &quot; &quot; progresive wave reactor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the fuel , that &apos;s really the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture of a place in kentucky .
these are wasted , the 99 percent remains after consumed the part that are burning now .
it &apos;s called the poor uranium .
cover the united states needs for hundreds of years .
and through the simple water filtration in a necostisitor process , we had enough fuel for the whole life of the planet .
so we &apos;re waiting for a lot of difficulty , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think , how can we evaluate ?
what should our notes look like ?
well , let &apos;s see where we need to get , and then look at the passions .
for 2050 you &apos;ve heard a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s very important to get there .
and the 20 percent will be consumed by what &apos;s going on in poor countries and beyond agriculture .
hopefully we &apos;re going to be cleaning silviculture , civiculture .
to get to 80 percent , developing countries , including countries like china , they &apos;ll have to modify their electricity production .
the other note is if we apply this technology with zero emissions , if we put it into all the developing countries and we &apos;re in the rest of the world .
this is great important .
this is a key element in completaring the note meat .
we &apos;re doing a step back : what should the note report look like in 2020 ?
well , again , it should have two elements .
we should apply these effective measures to begin to get reductions .
the less we emits , the less co2 is going to be the amount of co2 , and so , the lower temperature .
but in a sense , the note that we get , doing things that don &apos;t go to big reductions , is just equal or maybe even a little bit less important than the other , which is the innovation portion of these progress .
these progresss have to advise at the maximum speed , and that &apos;s what we can measure with companies , the pilot projects and regulation that have changed .
they wrote a lot of excellent books on this .
&quot; al gore &apos;s book , &quot; &quot; our choice , &quot; &quot; and david mackay &apos;s book , &quot; &quot; sustainable energy , &quot; &quot; &quot;
they take it all together and they create a structure so that people can talk about these things , because we need a broad support for that .
there must be a lot of things to be put together .
it &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish for us to invent this technology .
if i could just choose a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose who was president , i could pick a vaccine , which passionate me , or i could pick this : half a price energy , no co2 .
i would choose it .
it has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t have this wish , the division between people who think shortrt and long term is going to be terrified , between the united states and china , between poor countries and rich countries , and particularly life of those two billion people will be much worse .
what do we need to do ?
what do you want to do on you to do , and put it in motion ?
we need more research funds .
when countries are meeting , for example , copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t talk about co2 .
it should talk about this kind of innovation plan .
they would surprise you how ridiculous little are spending for these innovative research .
it also requires market stimulus , taxa on co2 , of stock markets , to hear the signal of prices .
we need to spread the message .
it has to be more rational , more wiser , including the measurements that the government takes .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can do .
thank you .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you. thank you .
thank you. to better understand about the terrapower , first of all , can you offer an idea of investment scale ?
bill gates : to make software , buy supercomputer , hiring scientists , which i did , are only tens of millions .
even after we test the materials in a russian reactor to be sure that our materials work out , we &apos;ll just get hundreds of millions .
the hard part of this is the pilot reactor building , finding a few billion people , of authority , has handed the building of the first one .
after building the first one , if you go to the ad , then it &apos;s clear that the daylight , because the economy , energy density , are very different from the ordinary field in nuclear field .
ca : so to understand how we need , that &apos;s supposed to build in the ground , to the depth of a kind of nuclear fuel column , this type of uranium consumption , and then the process starts up and somehow go down ?
bg : so it is. today all of you have to realize reactor that there are many people and lots of devices that can mistake , in that place where you open and move objects inside and outside .
that &apos;s not good .
if you have very cheap fuel you can let 60 years--we can look at it with a bustean , and you don &apos;t have the same complexity .
it &apos;s just sitting there and it burns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s ready .
ca : it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is also our own waste @-@ clear solution .
bg : yeah. well , what &apos;s going on with the waste , you can leave them there--there &apos;s a lot less waste in this way--and then you can actually take it and put it in another burning there .
and we start with the waste that exist today , now in cool cool basins or dry land in the reactive .
from this fuel we start .
the thing that &apos;s a problem for these reactors is really the first matter for ours , and we reduce the volume of waste waste through this process .
ca : but in the conversations with different people around the world about possibilities , where did you find the biggest interest to do something concrete ?
bg : i didn &apos;t choose a precise place , and there &apos;s all these non @-@ nuclear divided rules .
we &apos;re interested in a lot that people in the company went to russia , india , china .
i met here with the minister of energy and talked about this idea in energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic. you know that french and japanese have done something .
this is a variant of something that has already done .
it &apos;s an important development , but it &apos;s like a rapid reactor and a lot of countries built them , so any of the countries that have built a rapid reactor can be in which the first one is going to be built .
ca : what do you think , when and what do you have to do is you do concrete ?
bg : for one of the big electrical electrical generations that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent it and then 20 years to implement it .
this is the limiting term that environmental models have shown us that we need to respect .
and the terrapower , if things go well , what &apos;s a big wish , it could easily respect the term .
now , luckily , tens of companies , we need to be hundreds , which also , if their research works well , if funding for their pilot reactive works well , i can compete for that .
and it &apos;s best if i succeed more , because then we could combine things .
we need one to succeed .
ca : as possible changes on large scales , is this the biggest one you know ?
bg : a energy revolution is the most important thing .
it would have been even without the environment limitations , but the environment limitations do it more significant .
in nuclear field , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know them as well as this , but there are those who go to modularity , which is another way .
there &apos;s also a liquid reactor , which seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they also tell the same about us .
so there &apos;s a variety .
beauty is that a uranium molecule has a million times more energy than , say , one of coal .
so if we can solve the negative parts , which is essentially the radiation , then the ecological footprint , the cost , the potential , as effect on the land , and so on , the uranium is almost almost a classroom of one .
ca : but what if it doesn &apos;t work ?
are we going to have to start taking emergency measurements to maintain the temperature of stable earth ?
bg : if we get to this situation , it &apos;s like eating too much and you &apos;re on the point of having a heart attack .
what do you do ? you can need heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a direction of research in what &apos;s called geoenginerie , which is a different techniques that &apos;s beaten up to heating 20 or 30 years , until we organize .
but that &apos;s just an insurance police .
hopefully not need it .
some people say , we shouldn &apos;t even work on insurance polymers , because we could do our lazy , that we &apos;ll continue to eat because we know we &apos;ll save our heart surgery .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s wise , given the importance of problems , but there &apos;s in geoenginerie , this talk , if we shouldn &apos;t hold the police in your pocket that things are precision or if this innovation goes far slower than we expect .
ca : climate skeptics : in a sentence or two , what would you tell them to convince them wrong ?
bg : unfortunately , skeptics are different camps .
those of you who have scientific arguments are very few .
i say there &apos;s a lot of reaction effects of clouds that change things ?
there are very , very few things i can tell .
they have a chance of a million to be right .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
you do mistake now and you pay for it much later .
when you have all kinds of urgent problems , the idea is to support pain now to have a win later , and the pain is somewhat trying .
we actually have the ipcc report , which doesn &apos;t reflect the worst case , and there are people in the rich world looking at the ipcc , and they say , leave , it &apos;s not that big deal .
in fact , the uncertainty should be reasoning to do this .
&quot; but my dream here is to get a economic yield and simultaneously respect the co2 limits , and then skeptics will say , &quot; &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care i don &apos;t really care that i wouldn &apos;t emits co2 , but i &apos;d accept it because it &apos; s
ca : so this would be your answer to bjorn lomborg &apos;s argument , who says that if it consumes so much energy to solve co2 problem , it doesn &apos;t remain for the other goals , to try to escape the world of poverty , malaria and others , that we &apos;re wasted
bg : in fact , the spending spending for the research and development--let &apos;s say that the united states should spend 10 billion a year more than now--i &apos;m not as dramatic .
there wouldn &apos;t be other things that are going on .
the thing you spend a lot , and here reasonable people can &apos;t agree , is when you try to finance something unprecedented .
this , for me , is largely wasted , beyond the situation when you &apos;re almost ready , and you just finance learning curves , and it &apos;s going to become very cheap .
i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if we get to compromise to make super expensive energy , then richness can enable that .
any of us here may pay five times more on energy without changing our lifestyle .
disaster is for the two billion .
and even lomborg changed .
his position is : why don &apos;t it talk more about research ?
because of the things in the past is associated with the camp of skeptics , but he realized he &apos;s a pretty lonely camp , so he put the problem of research .
it &apos;s a farama of something right , i think .
the research and development is a crazy how bad it is .
ca : bill , i guess i &apos;m talking about the names of most here when i say i &apos;m going to tell you that i &apos;m going to come up with you. thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
i want to share with you a discovery a few months ago , while i was writing an article for wired italian .
when i write , i always have the dictionary to the food .
but i &apos;ve already finished writing the article , and i realized that i never looked for the word disability in the dictionary .
let me read you the definition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; disability , &quot; &quot; unfortunately , helpless , unfortunately , destroyed , stagnated , mutilated , swap , swap , olog , exhausted , exhausted , impotent , castrated , castrated , paralyzed ,
you see hurt , useless and weak .
antonime : healthy , powerful , capable .
i read the list of a friend and i started laughing .
it was absurre .
&quot; and after i went to &quot; &quot; scratch , &quot; &quot; he left me the voice and i had to stop and come back to my emotional shock . &quot;
it was my old dictionary .
i thought maybe , maybe it was printed earlier .
but it came out of printing in the early &apos; 80s , when i started elementary school , and i started to understand where i &apos;m still stilldreded outside my family and how i report to other kids and the world around me .
thank god i didn &apos;t use a dictionary .
after this definition , it turns out i was born in a world who thought someone like me had no positive trait .
but today , i &apos;m grateful for opportunities and adventures that my life took .
so , i immediately looked immediately in the online edit in 2009 , hoping to find a major change .
here &apos;s the new version of definition .
unfortunately , there &apos;s nothing better .
&quot; the last two words below &quot; &quot; almost antonime , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m disturbing , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; viguros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not just the words are the problem .
it matters what we think about the people we call this way .
it &apos;s about the values behind words and how we build them .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including greeks and romanii , they thought a blestem on orale was very strong , because when you &apos;d say it with loud voice , you had to exist .
so what is it that we want to create ?
a person who has limitations or a strong person ?
in fact , we call a man , a child , we may stop the power that it has .
wouldn &apos;t we better open a door ?
a man who opened me a door was my childhood doctor , from the institute of a. i. dupont , from wilmington , delaware .
his name is dr. pizzutillo .
the american of italian origin , whose name seems to be too difficult to do american .
so he was telling his dr. p .
dr. p. always wears colorful , and she always needed to work with children .
i loved time at the hospital , except for physics therapy .
i had to do countless exercises with these heavy elastic elastic lanes , different colors , to support my feet from my feet .
we hate all of those comics .
we hate them .
although i was five years old , i was trying to convince dr. p. let me leave you to give up those exercise , of course , without any success .
one day , she came to my meeting . . .
--there were painful meetings and exhausted meetings . . .
&quot; and she said to me , &quot; &quot; aimee , you &apos;re such a strong girl , &quot; &quot; that i think you &apos;re going to run one of these hairs . &quot; &quot; and when you &apos;re going to run it , i &apos;m going to give you 100 dollars . &quot; &quot; this was the
but what he did was transforming a daily obligation into a new and promising experience .
and i &apos;m also wondering what the measure of me said i &apos;m a strong girl influenced the way i see me today , as a strong and athletes .
this is an example of how adults who have power can trigger the power of a child .
but through those definition of dictionary , our language is not allowing us to create the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individual to consider capable .
our language is not in power with changes of society , many of them being produced by technology .
of course , from a medical point , my feet , the laser surgery for vision , the knees of titan for knees and hips , that allow people to put their skills and overcome the limits of nature on them , so that we can &apos;t talk about social media platforms , that allow people to self-
maybe technology has now reveal us more clearly what was always true .
that every man has something rare and powerful to offer society , and that human ability to adapt is our biggest win .
the human ability to adapt is an interesting thing , because people always want to talk to them about the purchasing of adversity and i &apos;m going to make you a confession .
i never liked this expression , and i responded to the people &apos;s questions about it .
i think i started to understand why .
implicit in the problem of adversitypasition is also the idea that success or happiness is about success of a heavy experience , not to be left by this , as if my successes in my life come from schools from schools to schools , or what others see that my disability .
but in fact , we &apos;re changing. we &apos;re obviously tagged by a physical or emotional challenge .
i want to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not an obstacle that we have to overcome , so we can live our lives next .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
i think it &apos;s kind of my shadow .
sometimes i see it pretty much , sometimes it &apos;s less , but it &apos;s always with me .
i &apos;m not trying to diminishing the impact of a person with adversity .
in life there are adversity and challenges for each of us , but the question is not whether you &apos;re going to meet this adversity , but the way you &apos;re going to react to it .
so our debt is not just protecting its adversity people who we love , but also to prepare them to fight .
we &apos;re making them a deserzing kids , when we make them feel uncapable to adapt .
there &apos;s an important difference between the medical that we have suffered a amputation and subjective opinion of society , if we or not disability .
and to be honest , the only real disability i &apos;ve been dealing with was that the world thinks that i could have described by those definitions .
from our wish to protect those who we love , telling them the truth about diagnostic , or diagnostic about future quality of their lives , we have to be careful not to be the first to feel inferior .
that you just see what &apos;s wrong with you can be much more harmful than patology itself .
because we don &apos;t treat the person in the totality and we don &apos;t recognize them resilient , we transmit them another river over the other problems that he has .
we basically evaluate that human importance in society .
so we have to see the pathology of the things that a man is capable of .
and particularly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiente and the biggest creative ability of ours .
we don &apos;t have to devalue these difficult moments , avoid them or move them , but to find the opportunities that adversity present .
the idea i want to point out is not only to overcome the adversity , but to open up it , embrace it , knock @-@ out , to use a sports term , perhaps to dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;ll see adversity as something natural , consistent and useful , something that doesn &apos;t pull us down .
in this year , charles darwin &apos;s 200 years , and 150 years ago , when he wrote about evolution , darwin struck a truth about the human character .
to paraphrase , not the most powerful species survive and no smartest , but that can adapt to change .
conflict generates creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among other things , we can see that human ability to survive and flourish is held by the battle of human spirit , from conflict to transformation .
once again , transformation , adapting is the biggest attribute of man .
and maybe , until we &apos;re testing , we don &apos;t know why we are capable .
maybe this gives us the adversity : a sense of self , knowledge of our own power .
so we can make ourselves a gift .
we can redefine adversity like something more than some heavy times .
we can see it as a change .
adversity is the change we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest adversity i created is the idea of normality .
who is normal ?
there is no normality .
there are common traits , typical , but not normal .
and would you really want to know such a banal person ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradigm from the aspiration to normality or force , to say a little bit more , we can release the force of many children and we can support them to use their valuable skills in the community .
anthropologists tell us that the only thing we people , we asked from the community members was to be used , to contribute .
it &apos;s found that the neanderthal people , 60 , 000 years ago , they were carrying the old ones and the physical deficiente , and maybe because their experience of survival turned out to be valuable for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as infirm or unfortunately .
they were considered bad and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a market in my hometown , in that red area in the pennsylvania denial , and i was looking at a red box .
it was summer. i was in short pants .
&quot; i heard the voice of a man behind me , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no aimee mullins . &quot; &quot; and i went back and i saw a old man i didn &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; &quot; excuse me. do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; you wouldn &apos;t be able to remember me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we met , we &apos;re just helping your mother to be born . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he was .
and i remembered it .
that man was dr. kean , a man i just knew from my mom &apos;s stories , because i usually came to the world with a couple of weeks delay .
and my mom &apos;s doctor left on vacation .
so the one who helped to bring my world was a stranger for my parents .
and because i was born without the ticking , and because i had the legs that i was laughing and only a few fingers on my feet , he had to give the bad news .
&quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; i had to say to your parents , &quot; &quot; that you &apos;re never going to go , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re never going to have the mobility that other kids have , &quot; &quot; or independent life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but you &apos;ve shown me that i was wrong . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s more extraordinary is that it &apos;s kept the newspaper articles in the newspaper that i came up with , since my childhood . &quot;
when i won the orthodox contest in the second grade , when i was with the other research in halloween &apos;s halloween &apos;s parade , when i took my college or my mistakes .
he gave them the residents of residents , the medicine students from hahnemann and hershey .
and he called this x @-@ factor , the potential of human will .
no diagnostic could sit in the path of the power of the will , as it &apos;s determined in the quality of somebody &apos;s life .
&quot; and dr. kean told me , &quot; &quot; from my experience , if it doesn &apos;t tell the opposite , &quot; &quot; and if it &apos;s also the smallest support , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s left to do what it wants , a child will perform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr. kean did that change in mentality .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the diagnosis of the doctor and the way anyone respond to it .
and my mindset has changed over time .
if you asked me 15 years if i would give the prostheses in exchange of meat and os , i wouldn &apos;t have ezitat a second .
at that time , i would aspire to that kind of normality .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so safe .
&quot; and that &apos; s &quot; &quot; thanks to the experiences that we had with them , and not in spite of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps this change in me has been produced because i was exposed to more people who opened my doors than those who closed them in front of me .
so , you see , you don &apos;t need one person to have the revelation of the power , and you &apos;re on the right way .
if you can give someone the key to its own power , the human spirit is so skeptical . . . if you can do that , and you open them a door at a very crucial moment , you educate it as we need .
you learn it to open its doors .
&quot; in fact , the word &quot; &quot; educate &quot; &quot; has rooted &quot; &quot; root . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about to put in the back of the plan that &apos;s inside , to make the potential value .
so , again , what potential do we want to get out of obvious ?
there was a case of case in the u. k . , in the &apos; 60s , when they went from classic schools to the different classes .
it &apos;s about the categories of students .
they &apos;re separated with a , b , with c , etc .
students with having a harder programmer , the best teachers , etc .
for three months , the students of d received a , they told me they were to , they were told they were smart .
after this three @-@ month period , they had a note performance .
the revers of medalia was that the students had told me that i am a note .
and this happened after the three months .
some of them were in school. others gave up at studies .
the crucial part of this study is that teachers were broken .
they didn &apos;t know that something changed .
they were told that students had also had d .
and they treated him .
i think the onlyicap is a zdrobit spirit , which has no hopeless .
i don &apos;t see beauty anymore .
he doesn &apos;t have the natural curiosity of the child and the innate capacity to imagine .
if , instead , we can determine the spirit of a human to keep the hope , see the beauty of itself and others , be curious and full of imagination , means we use our power as we need .
when a spirit has those qualities , we can create new reality and new ways to be .
i want to leave you with a poem , written by a poet persan from the second , 14 named hafiz , who said to me , my friend jacques dembois .
&quot; poetry is called &quot; &quot; god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; every child met god . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no god of words , &quot; &quot; not god of interdictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a god who knows only four words and all repeats them , &quot; &quot; saying , come on , come up with me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; come and dance with me . &quot; &quot; thank you . &quot;
