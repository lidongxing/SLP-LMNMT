a few years ago, here at ted, peter skillman presented a design problem called the armor problem.
and the idea is pretty simple.
teams of four has to build the highest self-state structure in 20 sticks of spaghetti, a adhesive tape tape, and a darkhouse.
the oil has to sit in the top.
and although it seems pretty simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly.
and so i thought this is an interesting idea, and embedded it into a seminar of design.
and it was a great success.
and since then, i kept about 70 seminars of design all over the world with designers and architects, even the top 50 fortune directors, and something in this exercise took good learning about the nature of collaboration, and i'd like to share with you a few of you.
so, normally people start by evaluating the task.
talk about it, imagine what it's going to look like, it's fighting for power, and then it's going to spend something time planning, organizing.
they're changing and they're showing the spaghettis most of their time assemble the sticks in the structure that are high, and then finally, when they don't have time, somebody's taking off the darkness, and put it delicate on the top, they' re
they admire their work.
" but what's actually happening in most cases, is that" " ta-da" " turns into a" " oh-oh, " " because the weight of the darkness makes the whole structure to deformeze and fall. "
" and there's a number of people who have much more moments of" " oh-oh, " " than others, and among the most disbelievable people are found in business graduates. "
they lie, cheating, lose their concentration, and they realize the jalnice structures.
" and of course, there's teams that have a lot more structures, " " ta-da, " " and, among the best people, they're kindergarten graduates. "
and it's pretty amazing.
as peter says, it's not only producing the highest structures, it's also the most interesting of all.
so you'd like to ask, how on earth? why? why?
" and peter likes to say, " " none of the kids don't lose time trying to be ceo at spaghetti srl. " " that's it. "
and it doesn't lose time fighting for power.
but there's another reason.
this is that students are trained to find the only plan right, right?
and he's executed it.
and what's going on is that when they put the top, they're in the crisis of time, and what's going on?
it's a crisis.
sound familiar? that's it.
what they do different kinds of kindergarten kids, is that they start with the bezeua, and they build prototypes, successful prototypes, keep in the top of the darkness, so they have more opportunities to remedie the prototypes wrong on the way.
so designers recognize this kind of collaboration as the essence of iterative process.
and every version, the kids have a immediate response to what works and what doesn't work.
so the ability to build in prototypes is essential, and let's see how different teams behaves.
so the average average is about 20 tols, students, are about half, lawyers, a little bit better, but not a lot of kindergarten children, better than most adults.
who's the best one?
architects and engineers, fortunately, the highest structure i saw has 39 toles.
and why is that? because they understand that triangles and models of self-portant models are the key to build by stable structures.
so generali executives, a little bit better than the media.
but here's where it gets interesting.
if you add the team of a man from the waist, the result improves significantly.
" it's incredible. you see, you look around and say, " " that's the winning team. " " "
you can say that before. why is that?
because they have special competitions skills.
i run the process, i understand the process.
and any team that monitors, and it's attention to work will improve performance.
technically technical skills, and their combination leads to success garantat.
if you have 10 teams that begin to build, you'll have about six structures that are going to sit in.
and i tried something interesting.
i thought, let's raise the stake.
and i gave a 10 thousand dollars in computer programs for the winner team.
and what do you think it happened to those students at design?
what was the result?
here's what happened.
no team has built something to stay on.
if any team were built, let's say, a three-centimeter structure, it could have taken home.
so, it's not interesting that big stakes have a strong impact?
i repeated the exercise with the same students.
what do you think has happened?
now they've just done the prototype value.
and the same team has gone from the weakest result to one of the best results.
they cost the highest structure in the shortest time.
so here's some deep lessons for us about nature of motivations and success.
so, could you ask, why would anyone lose time writing such a problem?
and the reason is, i help to create digital tools and processes used by teams that are building machines and video games and visual effects.
and what this challenge does is it's that it's helping them identify hidden assumptions.
because, in fact, every project has its own fly, right?
this challenge provides us a common experience, a common language, a common position in the building of a right prototype.
and so, this is the value of this experience, this exercise so simple.
and for those of you, you can access. marshmallowchallenge. com is a blog where you can see how to build with the darkness.
they're also peaceful instructions about it.
there are also unusual examples around the world as people change and adjust the system.
you can also find world records.
and the fundamental lesson, i think it's the fact that design really is a contact sport.
it asks us to dedicate all the senses, and apply what we've got better thinking, feelings and facts for our challenge.
" and sometimes, a simple prototype of this experience is the only thing we need to make a moment" " oh-oh" " at a moment, " " "
and that can make a difference.
thank you very much.
suppose we have a machine, a big machine, formidable, ted style, which is a time machine.
and everybody in this room has to go into it.
you can go back or before, but you can't stay where you are.
i wonder what you'd choose, because i put friends this last night, and everybody wanted to travel back in time.
" i don't know. they want to go back to the invention of the automobile, before twitter or" " american idol. " " "
i don't know.
i'm sure there's a certain attraction to understand this.
but i have to say i'm not part of this group.
i don't want to go back to time and not because i don't have the adventure spirit, but because that's the palette of options on this planet doesn't regress, it's moving.
so i want to go into the car and go ahead.
it's the best time of this planet you've looked at: health, wealth, furniture, chance, chance, the descendants of sickness.
there was no longer no time.
all my grandparents died before 60 years old.
my grandparents came to 70.
my parents come closer to 80.
so there's good to be new figure at the beginning of the age that i'm going to die.
but it's not even about people like this, because it's much more important than that.
a child who's born in new delhi has a higher life expectancy than she had the richest man in the world 100 years ago.
think about that. it's an incredible phenomenon.
and why is that true?
smallpox. smallpox killed billion people.
he repeated the demographic data of the planet in an unqualified way of anything else.
it's no longer. it's gone.
i've convinced it. i've got it.
in the rich world, diseases that threaten millions of people with only one generation ago.
difteria, rubeola, polio. . .
does anyone know what all that means?
vaccines, modern drugs, our ability to feed billions of people are triumph of scientific methods.
and i think the scientific method, he put things to try, he saw if it works, it changes them if not, it's one of the most achievement of humanity.
these are good news.
unfortunately, there are no other problems because there are other problems, and there are many times, one of them, that despite all of our achievement, a billion people with sleeping every day.
this number grows very quickly, and it's rightly convicted.
not just that, but we used our imagination to destroy this planet completely.
drinking water, agricultural land, tropical forests, oil, gas: they're all on the sky and they'll disappear soon.
if we don't invent a way to come out of this mess, we will disappear.
the question is: can we do that? i think yes.
i think it's obvious that we can produce food that feeds billions of people without devastation of the earth that i live in.
i think we can feed this world with energy that will not destroy it.
i really believe that, and it's not just an illusion.
but here's what it doesn't let me sleep at night--one of the things that don't let me sleep.
we never needed the progress of science than now, and we've never ever learned in the situation to use it in the way we can do it today.
we're in the threshold of absolutely amazing events in more fields.
however, i think we should go back three hundred years before the enlightenment of the enlightenment, to discover a period where we fought for progress, for all these things with more force and more fronts than now.
people are growing fanatics of their belief that you can't freeze them.
it's not even going to release them.
everybody has the right to a opinion; it really has the right to have a opinion about progress, but you know what you don't have?
you don't have the right to your truth. i'm sorry, but that's it.
and it took me a while to figure that out.
" about 10 years ago, i wrote an article about vaccines for" " the new yorker" " ; a small article. "
i was amazed to be part of impotheses, against what, after all, it's the most effective public health in the whole history of humanity.
i didn't know what to do, so i did what i usually do, i wrote an article, and i went on.
soon after that, i wrote an article about genetically modified food.
the same thing, only more important.
people took a war.
" so i wrote an article and about this, and i couldn't understand why people thought it was" " frankenstein food, " " why they thought it was changing molecules in a certain way, not in a random, meant the laws of nature. "
but, as you already know, i do what i do. i wrote the article, i went on.
they're just journalists; we're typing, arhivam, we go to dinner, everything is fine.
but these articles were disturbed me, and i didn't realize why. then i understood.
it was because those fanatics who took me out of the mind were no fanatics.
they were people with good, education, in their place.
they were exactly like people in this room.
and it got me so much. . .
but then i thought, let's be honest.
we're at the point where we don't have the same relationship with progress as far.
we talk about it ambivalent.
" we're talking about it in ironic terms, and we're putting it between the guidelines: " " progress. " " "
okay, there are reasons for that, and i think we know what these reasons are.
we lost trust in institutions, in authority and sometimes in science.
and we have the right to do it.
you can get a few names and people will understand.
cernobyl, bhopal, challenger, rapexx, mass destruction, the wrong number of votes.
you can make your own list.
there are questions and questions about the people we think are always right.
so, be the circumspectation.
ask questions, make evidence and evidence.
don't take anything good.
but here's the idea: when you get evidence, you have to accept them. we don't really do that.
and i can tell it because we're in the middle of an epidemic of the fear of the scale of the size of the size of the world before and hopefully not to meet.
about 12 years ago, there was an article, a terrifying one, which was done between the epidemic of autism and the vaccine against the measles, the rice and rubeolei.
very frightening.
there have been countless studies to check if that's true.
they really needed to do count trials; it's an important problem.
and the results came.
results in the united states, from the u. k. , from sweden, and all of them said the same thing: there's no correlation, no connection, none of them.
it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter, because we take serious jokes, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real.
we don't think a lot of documents from a government functioning that gives us data, and i understand that, i think we all understand.
but you know what?
the results were disastrous, and here's why: the united states is one of the few countries in the world where the vaccination rate against rujes is down.
that's unbelievable, we should be ashamed.
it's terrible.
what happened to us here?
i understand, i really understand.
does anyone here look at me?
did anybody see anybody in the audience else dying by measles?
it doesn't happen.
this country is not happening at all, but 160, 000 times around the world last year.
a lot of deaths because of measles, 20 cases per hour.
but, because here's not what happened, we can't think about it and people like jenny mccarthy can propfy fear and ignorance using emissions like oprah and larry king.
and i can do that because i don't make the difference between causality and correlation.
they don't understand that they seem the same thing, but they're never coined.
and we have to learn this as soon as it is.
this guy, jonas sulk, was a hero.
we got rid of one of the largest napastes of humanity.
no fear, no agony, polio disappeared.
the guy in the middle--not too much.
his name is paul offit.
and that's exactly what a vaccine developed against a rotavirus together with some other.
it saves 400, 500, 000 children's lives in developing countries every year.
good result, right?
it's good, except paul talks about vaccines and how precious they are, and that people should just stop complaining.
that's how they formulate.
so paul is a terrorist.
when paul talks to a public hearing, it can't witnesslessly not to be protected by armed fence.
it's called home because people like to tell them that i know what school goes to his children.
why? because paul did a vaccine.
i don't need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
if you remove them, the disease comes back, terrible diseases, and that's right now.
in this country we have ruinedola.
it's worse and worse, and the kids will die again because of that, because it's just a statistical problem.
and they're not going to die by ruinedola.
what about polio? let's have that. why not?
two weeks ago, a college college was written, and he said he seems like i'm cam strident.
nobody told me that before.
he was not going to vaccinate his child against polio.
in no case.
all right.
why? because we don't have polio. you know what?
yesterday, there were no polio cases in this country.
but today, i don't know, maybe a guy grew up in an airplane from lagos and landing on the airport in los angeles, now it's above ohio state.
it will land over two hours, it will rent a car and come to long beach and participate in one of these wonderful tedsters in this evening tonight.
he doesn't know he's infected with a disease that causes paralysis, and we don't know, because that's how the world works.
this is the planet we live. let's not pretend that it's not like this.
we like to put ourselves in lies. we like that to crazy.
did everybody take the vitamins in the morning?
it' schinacea, slightly antioxidant to work.
i know you did that because half the u. s. population does this every day.
they take these things and they apply to alternative medicine, and they don't matter how often we find that they are completely useless.
data shows the same thing.
they make your urine more closed to color, and usually, nothing more.
it's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for urine closed closed.
you don' t.
urine closed to color. closed to color.
why do we do that?
i think i understand--i hate big pharmaceutical producers.
we hate government. we don't trust.
and we shouldn't have. our public health system is born.
it's related to millions of people.
it's incredibly cold and distrugators of souls of people that allow us to allow us.
so we run by him. and where are we running?
right in the arm of the great placebo.
it's fantastic. i love the great placebo.
but, in fact, it's really serious because these things are stuff of stuff and we spend on them billions of dollars.
i have here all kinds of score objects.
none of them--ginkgo, teapa, echinacea, teapa, that, i don't even know what it is, but we spend billions of dollars on this, teapa.
" and you know what? when i say that, people print to me and say, " " what do you care? leave people to do what they want, it makes them feel good. " " "
you know what? you're wrong.
" because i don't care if the secretary of state in the ministry of health is the one that says, " " hmm, i'm not going to consider the evidence of my mammograms looking at mammograms, " " or there's some sarlatan that wants to treat
when you push it on the way that faith and magic replace evidence and science, you get in a place where you don't want to be.
you get to thabo mbeki south africa.
it killed 400, 000 people who insistand as red sfeclae, the landboard and the lamaie oil are much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs that we know that slow down the aids progress.
hundreds of thousands of deaths free in a devastated country more than any other disease.
please don't tell me that there is no consequences for that.
there are. there are always.
the most exciting epidemic that really stuck right now is this absurre struggle between the defense of genetically modified food and elitions of organic food.
it's a tampita controversy. it's got to stop.
it's a controversy about words, metaphors.
it's ideology, not science.
whatever i eat, every bob of rice, every four-njel wire, every brussels of brussels has changed by man.
in the garden of eden, there were no mandarins.
and no yellow gallerys.
there were no christmas cheese. we did it.
i did this in the last 11, 000 years.
some of them were okay, others don' t.
i got rid of the ones that weren' t.
now we can do it in a more accurate way.
of course, there are risks.
but we can put vitamin in rice, and that can help millions of people, just millions of people, taking their lives.
don't you want to do that?
i have to say i don't understand.
we protest against genetically modified food.
why do we do that?
well, we're always hearing things like: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monogamtors, we don't want huge surfaces that one thing grow, is wrong.
we don't want companies to patent life.
we don't want companies to have seeds.
you know what my answer is all of this?
yeah, you're right. let's fix that.
this is, we have a big problem with food, but that's not science.
this has nothing to do with science.
it's law, it's morality, patent stuff.
you know science is not represented by a company.
it's not a country.
it's not even an idea; it's a process.
it's a process that sometimes works, and sometimes not, but the idea that we shouldn't afford science to do their work because we're afraid is very disconnected and prevent millions of people to thrive.
over the next 50 years, we're going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today.
70 percent.
here's what investment have done in africa for the last 30 years.
shame. shame.
they need that, and we don' t.
why? genetically modified food.
we don't want to encourage people to eat the pigs like manioc.
500 million people eat manioc.
it's kind of like a potato.
just calories. it's terrible.
it has no nutrition, it doesn't have proteins, and scientists put all this into it right now.
and then people will be able to eat it without blind.
they don't want hungry and you know what?
it would be good. it wouldn't be like chez panisse, but it would be good.
all i can say is, why do we hypotheses?
let's ask ourselves the question: why do we hypotheses?
because we don't want to change genes?
it's just about changing genes. not about chemicals.
it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, about insistence of having larger food, better food, particularly food.
it's not about cereal for breakfast, it's about keeping people alive and it's time to understand what that means.
because, you know what?
if we don't do it, if we continue to wear the way we're wearing right now, we'll be guilty of something that we don't think we want to be guilty, which is high-tech colonization.
we can't describe otherwise what's going on.
it's selfish, it's ugly, it's under our level, and we really have to stop.
" so after this incredibly funny talk, you might say, " " so, you still want to go into this tricky car of time to travel into the future? " " "
sure. of course, yeah.
now it's stuck today, but we have an amazing opportunity.
we can program the car for anyway.
we can move it anywhere, and that's what we're going to do.
we need to wear these conversations and we need to think, but when we go to the time, we're going forward, we'll be happy to do that.
i know that we can and after my opinion, that's exactly what the world needs now.
thank you.
thank you.
one day the steve lopezaris at los angeles times the streets of los angeles when he heard a beautiful music.
and the source was a man, a delightful american african, necizelat, a street man, playing a violin that only had two tails.
and i'm telling you a story that many of you know, because steve wrote a lot of articles that became a book, after a movie, with robert downey jr, like steve lopez, and jamie fox like nathaniel anthony ayers, with juilliard
nathaniel gave up school, it's been through a total fall, and 30 years later, without home, lived on the streets in skid row in the center of los angeles.
i'm going to recommend you to read steve's book or see the movie to understand not just the beautiful connection that came between these two people, but also how music helped that links, and eventually it was instrumental, sorry for words, to help nathaniel don't sit on the
i met mr. ayers in 2008, two years ago, at walt disney concerts.
i had just heard the interpretation of the symphony and the fourth of beethoven and came behind the scenes and presented.
he was talking in a very jovial and sociable way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton, and how dodgers will never get in the final, everything because of a violin password in the last part of beethoven's fourth symphony.
i talked about music. i got a email from steve a few days later saying nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
now, i have to mention that nathaniel refusing to make treatment, because when he was treated with shock therapy and thorazine and catuse, and he left the cicatrici that will remain all his life.
but as a result now, it's taught to these schizophrenia episoade.
the worst of them can manifest that he's exploding, and disappearing more days, taking on the streets of skid row, exposed to those horror, with torture from the mind of disadvantaged on it.
and nathaniel was very nervous when we started our first lesson at walt disney had a kind of crazy sparked spark, was lost.
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and as someone poisoning it in sleep.
and i was afraid to me, not to me, but i was afraid i'm going to lose it, that it's going to dive in one of his own states, and i'm going to destroy his violin relationship if i'm going to start talking about game and arpezed
so i started playing.
and i played the first part of beethoven's violin concert.
and as i sang, i realized that a profound change occurs in nathaniel's eyes.
it was as though it was underneath invisible drugs, a chemical reaction, which music of me was catalyst.
and nathaniel's maniacala's maniacala's manifestod in understanding, an quiet curiosity and grace.
and like in a miracle, he raised his own violin, and he started playing, after his ear, some fragments from the violin for violin that he asked me to complete, mendelssohn, tchaikovsky, andbelius.
and we started talking about music, from bach to beethoven, and brahms, bruckner, all from letters b, bartok, to esa-pekka salonen.
and i realized that he didn't just have encyclopedias about music, but he had a personal connection to music.
she was talking about her with that passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues at filarmonic in los angeles.
and as we interpret and talked to the music this man turned from a paranoid man who had just come from the streets of los angeles, in this delight, erudit, genius, educating juilliard.
music is therapy. music changes us.
and for nathaniel, music is psychological health.
because music enables them to take their own thoughts and illusions, and transform them through his imagination and his creativity, in reality.
and this is an escape from his suffering.
and i realized that this is the essence of art.
this is why we do music, we take something that exists in us, essentially our fundamental emotions, and with our help of our artistic filters, with our creativity, we shape those emotions.
and the reality of that expression touches all of us, and it impresss us, inspires us and unite.
and for nathaniel, music brought him back to embrace friends.
the eliberative power of music brought it back into a family of musicians that understand it, that recognizes the talents and respect it.
i'm always going to make music with nathaniel, whether we're at walt disney, or in skid row, because it reminds me of why i became a musician.
thank you.
bruno giussani: thank you. thank you.
robert gupta.
robert gupta: i want to play something that i've stolen without shame from cellos.
so, please forgive me.
i'm jane mcgonigal. i'm a games designer.
i create online games 10 years already.
and my goal for the next decade is to try to make saving the world in real life as the world can save the world in online games.
now, i have a plan for that, and it involves getting more people, including the present here, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
right now, we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
" some of you might think, " " it's a lot of time spent playing games. " " "
perhaps too much time, given how many emergency issues we need to solve in the real world.
but, according to my research, at the future institute, it's exactly on the ground.
three billion hours per seven is not even far enough for games to solve the most urgent problems of the world.
in fact, i think, if we want to survive the future of centuries on this planet, we have to dramatically grow this number of hours.
we've calculated the whole thing we need at 21 billion game every week.
so, that's probably a little bit of a counter-intuitive idea.
so i'm going to tell it again, i'll let it go.
if we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts, obesity, i think we have to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week until finele this decade. no. i'm serious.
here's why. this image is able to reliefate why i think games are so essential for the future of the survival of human species.
this is a portrait done by a photographer called phil toledano.
he wanted to capture the emotion of the player.
so he set up a room in front of the players, while they were playing.
and this is a classic game emotion.
now, if you're not a gamer, you might lose some of the nuance of this photograph.
you've probably noticed the need for action, a little bit of fear, but intense concentration, powerful attention to drawing a very difficult problem.
if you're a player, you're going to see some amazing things like the high-eyed eyes and around the mouths are signs of optimism.
and the eyebrows are a surprise sign.
this is a gamer that's near something called a epic win.
oh, you've heard of that. okay. all right.
so we have some gamers among us.
a epic win is a result that's so amazing positive that you didn't think you could achieve it until you didn't win it.
it was almost beyond the limits of imagination.
and when you get there you're so shocking to discover that you're really capable. this is a epic win.
this is a player on the way to get a epic win.
and this is the girl we need to see at millions of people who solve problems around the world as we try to remove the obstacles of the century.
someone who, against the ngos, is on the way to get a epic win.
now unfortunately, this is a girl that we see more often in everyday life, as we're looking at about emergency issues.
" this is what i call" " i'm not good at living. " " "
and here i am, doing this girl. can you see? yeah. all right.
" this is me doing" " i'm not good at living. " " "
here's a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood.
from berkley, california, where i took my ph. d. about why we are better in games than in real life.
and this is a problem that many gamers have.
we feel that we're not as good as we are in games.
" and i don't mean good as in" " successful, " " even if that's a new component we actually do in games than in real life, but when i say goodbye about doing something that matters, inspired to collaborate and cooperate. "
and when we're in virtual worlds, i think many of us become the best version of ourselves, the most willing to help at some point, the most likely to focus on a problem as it is necessary, to get up after failure and try.
in real life, when we're in front of failure, when we face obstacles, we don't feel like this.
we feel depasiti.
we feel anxious, perhaps depressed, frustrated or cinici.
we've never got that kind of feeling when we play, they just don't exist in games.
so, that's what i wanted to study when i finished my university.
what is in games doing impossible to make sure that there's nothing that we can't do?
how can we take these feelings of games and apply them to real life work?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft, which is really a collaboration environmental for solving problems.
and i started to notice a few things that make epic gains so plausible in online worlds.
so the first thing is, whenever you go into one of these online games in world of warcraft, you meet a lot, many characters that are willing to trust a mission that would save the world immediately.
but not any mission, but a perfect mission with your current level in the game. right?
so, you can go to the fulfilling.
i'll never give you an attempt you can't do.
but this is at the limit of what you can do. so you have to strive enough.
but there's no sleep in world of warcraft.
there's no state of degeaba and losing the time.
there's always something clear and important to do.
and also, there are tons of collaborators.
wherever you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to take your epic mission.
it's not something that is possible in real life, this feeling that at your degae are tons of collaborators.
and in addition, it's also this epic story, this kind of inspirational story about why we are there and what we do.
and then the first thing about this positive feedback.
you've heard about growth and plus one to power, plus one to intelligence.
we don't get this kind of feedback in real life.
when i go to this stage, i'm not going to have plus one to spoken and plus one to a trawler ideas, plus plus 20 to ideas.
i don't get these feedback in real life.
now, the problem with online collaboration environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfaction to be on the point of earning something epic all the time that we decide to spend all the time in these virtual worlds.
it's just better than that.
so far, all of the world's world-warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve virtual problems of today.
now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
it could sound like a bad thing.
but let me put this in context: 5.93 million years ago, it was the moment that our first human ancestors sat in.
that was the first primate that sat in the feet.
okay, so when we talk about how much time we invest in playing games, the only way that it makes sense to think about it, is to talk about time to the magnitude of human evolution, which is an amazing thing.
but it's also appropriate. because it turns out that by spending so much time playing games, we actually change what we are capable of doing as human beings.
we're evolving to a more collaborative and more heart.
that's true. that's what i think.
so, you take this interesting statistical statistics.
it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university.
the media of young people in this day today in a country with a powerful game culture will have spent 10, 000 hours playing games online by age 21.
now, 10, 000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons.
first of all, for kids in the united states 10.080 hours is exactly the number of hours that you're going to spend at the fifth class, and until you get high school if you're never missing from hours.
so we have a whole parallel of education that's going on where young people are learning as much about what you need to be a good gamer about everything else in school.
and some of you may have read malcom gladwell's new book called outliers.
so, you'll have heard of his theory about success, 10, 000 success theory.
it's based on that extraordinary research on cognitive domain that says that if we can resist 10, 000 hours of trial, anywhere until the age of 21, we'll be specialisted on that subject.
we'll be as good at whatever we do as the largest personality in the world.
and so, at what we're looking at now is a whole generation of young people who are specialized players.
" so the big question is, " " what exactly become the players so good? " " "
because if we could figure that out, we had a basic human resource that's basically untouched at the device.
here are how many people now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing games online games.
these are our experts' gamers.
500 million people who are pretty good at something.
and in the next decade we're going to have another billion players that are pretty good at anything is something.
if you don't already know, it's coming.
the developing game games that consume a little bit of energy and working on the basis of wireless phones instead of large tape internet so that gamers around the world mostly in india, china, brazil, they can connect online.
they estimate another billion games in the next decade.
this will bring us to 1.5 billion players.
so i started thinking about what these experts are doing.
these are the four things we've discovered. the first is the urgent optimism.
okay. think about it as an extreme motivation.
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately in front of an obstacle, combined with faith that we have a reasonable chance of success.
gamers always believed that a epic win is possible, and it always deserves to try and try, and it deserves now.
players don't sit down.
gamers are experts to ask a strong social fabric.
there's a lot of studies that show us that we like people more if we play a game with them, even if they knocked us bitterly.
and the reason is it takes a lot of confidence to play a game with somebody.
we trust that someone's going to spend their time with us, that he'll play after the same rules, they'll pretend the same purpose and they'll sit in the game to the end.
and so, playing a game with somebody actually build bonds and confidence and cooperation.
and as a result, we build more powerful social relationships.
happy productivity. i love that.
you know, there's a reason why the world of warcraft's world player plays 22 hours a week, think about a part of a part of part.
it's because you know, when we play a game, we're even happier working hard, rather than when we relax or when we come out with friends.
we know we're optimized as human beings to make hard and meaningful work.
and players are willing to work hard all the time, if they're doing the right work.
finally, meaning.
players love to be attached to missions that inspires stories on the planet scale.
so, just a little bit sad to help us see things in perspective.
so, you all know wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
the second largest wiki, almost 80, 000 articles is world of warcraft wiki.
five million people use it every month.
they have more information about world of warcraft through the internet than any other subject treated in any other wiki in the world.
they're growing a epic story.
they're focusing on a epic resource about world of warcraft.
okay, so we have this four superpower that is buying in one thing.
gamers are powerful individuals and hopeful.
they're people who think are individual capable of changing the world.
and the only problem is that they think they're able to change virtual worlds, but not real world.
this is the problem i'm trying to solve.
it's an economist called edward castronova.
his work is brilliant. he's studying why people invest so long and energy and money in virtual worlds.
" and he says, " " we're witnessed at what's connecting] nothing less than a mass exod to virtual worlds and online environments. " " "
: he's a economist. so he's rational.
and he says--not like me--i am a games designer and i'm exuberanta.
but he says, that actually has a clear sense because players can get more in online worlds than they can get in life.
they can have more powerful social relationships in games than in real life.
they get better fedback, and they feel more rewarded in games than in real life.
so, he says that now, it's clearly a sense for players to spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world.
now, i agree that this is rational, for the moment.
but it's not, in no case, a optimal situation.
we need to start doing the real world more like a game.
so, i'm pulling my inspiration from something that happened 2, 500 years ago.
these are ancient zaruri, created from the bones of a sheep. right?
before we had extraordinary jcour must have bones bone.
and these are the first game equipment created by human beings.
and if you're familiar with the historian of grec herodot, you may know this story.
which is the history of which invented games and why.
herodot said that games, and particularly zaruri games were invented in the lydiee kingdom at a time of hunger.
apparently, it was such a hunger that the king of lydiei decided that i had to do something crazy.
people were suffering. people were fighting.
it was a extreme situation. they needed an extreme solution.
so, according to herodot, they invented the zaruri games and defined a true policy all over the kingdom.
one day, every one of them will eat.
and the next day, everybody will play.
and they're going to be so focused on the zaruri games because games are so exciting and invalfested in such a satisfying productivity that they will ignore the fact that they didn't eat.
and so on the next day, they play games, and one day after, they will eat.
and according to herodotus, they lived 18 years, surviving a hunger eating one day and playing games in the other.
now, this is exactly, i think, the way we use games today.
we use games to get rid of suffering from the real world.
we use games to run away from everything that's broken in the real world, everything that's not gratifying about our lives, and we get what we need in games.
but you don't have to go there.
this is very interesting.
according to herodot, after 18 years, hunger doesn't attract.
so the king decided that they'll play a last game of zaruri.
they divided the whole kingdom in two.
they played a zaruri game, and the winners got the opportunity to go to a epic adventure.
they will leave lydia.
and they're going to go looking for a new place to live, leaving exactly the so many people to survive with few resources that were available, and hoping to drive civilization elsewhere where they can thrive.
now, that sounds crazy, isn't it?
but recently, the evidence of dna showed that eternal, who led the empire, had the same dna as the old lydiees of lydiees.
and so researchers suggested that herodot's fantastic story could be true.
and geologists found evidence about a global cool that lasted about 20 years, and that could have explained famine.
so, this crazy story could be true.
they could actually save their culture playing games playing games, get through the game for 18 years, and then be so inspired and know so much about how to do it through games that they even saved their whole civilization in this way.
okay, we can do that.
we play warcraft from 1994.
that was the first real-time strategy in the world of warcraft world. this was 16 years ago.
they played zaruri games for 18, we played warcraft for 16.
i say we're ready for our own epic game.
now they had half the civilization that left to look for a new world.
so, from here i pull my 21 billion hours of games a week.
let's get a half of us agree to play a half an hour a day of video games until we solve real problems.
" now i know you wondered, " " how can we solve real life problems in games? " " well, this is the theme that i've devoted my work over the last few years at the institute for the future. "
we have this banner to our offices in palo alto and express our opinion about how to try to relate to the future.
we don't want to try to predict the future.
what we want to do is create the future.
we want to imagine the best scenario.
and then we want to empower people to transform this scenario.
we want to imagine epic gains and then give people the means to get these epic gains.
i want to show you very briefly three of the games that we've done to give people the means to create epic gains in their own future.
so, that's the world without oil.
we created this game in 2007.
this is a online game where you try to survive a oil crisis.
the oil crisis is fictiva, but we put enough content there so that you can think it's real, and live your life as if we haven't had oil anymore. so when you come to this game you're wrong, you tell where you live.
and then we transmit video news in real time sources of data that shows you exactly how much oil costs, what it's not available, how it's affected the source of food, how it's affected the shipping, if schools shut down, if they're protests.
and you have to imagine how you're living your life if all of this would be true. and then you asked you to write in a blog about this, to public films, to public pictures.
i tested this game in 2007 with 1700 players.
and i've been watching her three years since.
and i can tell you it's an experience that turns you.
nobody wants to cheat their way of life only because it's good for the world, or because that's how we need it.
" but if you include them in a epic adventure and you tell them, " " we will stay without oil. " " "
this is a story and a fantastic adventure to imbark you.
let's make sure you see how you survive.
most of our players support their habits that they've learned in this game.
so for the game that can save the world, i decided to keep on higher, higher problems than the lack of oil.
i created a game called superstruct at the future institute.
and the premise was that a supercomigotor calculated that people have only spent 23 years on this planet.
the supercomputer is called global extinction system conscious system, of course.
i asked people to come up almost like jerry bruckheimer film.
you know the movie of jerry bruckheimer, it forms a team of dream.
you have the astronaut, the scientist, the former prisoner, and they all have something to do to make the world.
but in our game, instead of having only five people in this dream team, i said all of you are part of the team of dream and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security and the future of security.
i had a lot of people who played this game for eight weeks.
" they invented 500 creative solutions that you can see if you go online and look for" " superstruct" " on google. "
so finally, the last game is launching it into march. this is a play created in collaboration with the global banking institute if you can complete the game you'll be certificateed by world bank institute as a social innovation, 2010.
working with universities from all sub-saharan africa and they invite them to learn social innovation techniques.
we have a graphic novel. we have growth at attributes like the local intuition, the social socialization, the cause of support, vision and capacity to be filled with resources.
i'd like to invite you all of you to share this game with young people anywhere in the world, especially in developing areas that could benefit from meeting to try to start to imagine their own social companies that would save the world.
so, now i'm going to summarize.
i want to ask you something.
what do you think is going to happen beyond?
we have all these amazing players, we have these games that are sort of a pilot versions of what we could do, but none of these has rescued the world yet.
well i hope you'll agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use to work for real world, that games are a strong platform.
we all have these amazing superpowers, happy productivity, the ability to get a solid canvas of social relations, this feeling of urgent optimism, and desire to have a epic sense.
i hope from the soul that we can unique to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century.
and it's my hope that you're going to join and play games like this.
when i think about the next decade, i know two things that we can create anything we can imagine and we can play any games we want.
so, i say, to start games that changes the world.
thank you.
" for some time, i'm interested in the placebo effect, which would seem strange to a magician, just if you think about it as i think, which is, " " something fake thought about countries by someone becomes real thing. " " "
in other words, the sugar pills have a measured effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person believes that what's going on is a pharmaceutical or something similar. . .
for pain, for example, if it's thought to the country, in the body, there's a measured effect called the placebo effect.
something fake becomes something real because of how somebody perceive it.
to understand us, i want to start by showing you a rudimentary trick, a very simple trick.
and i'm going to show you how it works. this is a trick that you find in every magie book for kids since 1950.
and i learned from cube magiccout in 1970.
i'll show it, and then i'll explain it.
and then i'll explain why i explained it.
so here's what's going on.
knife, which you can examine; my hand, you can see it.
i'm going to hold the knife like this.
i'll pull you up.
and to make sure there's nothing i'm going to enter or comes out of my slums here.
so you can see that nothing goes on here.
as long as i'm holding there, i'm not going to go into it, and there's nothing out of my slaughter.
and it's pretty simple.
i'm going to open your hand, and i hope, if it's going well, my magnetism's animal will simply support the knife.
it's actually so well stupid that they can shake their hand, and the knife doesn't fall.
it doesn't go wrong to or out of your slaughter, no complete. and you can examine everything.
ta-da!
i often teach kids this trick on the magic, because you can learn a lot about the pacaleli studying whether it's very simple to do.
many of you here know it already.
here's what happens.
hold the knife in your hand.
and i say i'm going to hold my hand to make sure that there's nothing there, it's a lie.
the reason i'm holding for you is actually the secret of this illusion.
when my hand is moving from your face and you don't see it, this finger, the araer will move from where it is to a position like that.
hi.
there's a child with no childhood.
so, this is how it works like this.
and as i rotate, my finger is moving his position.
and we can discuss why it's going to induce that into the error, why don't you notice that there are only three fingers here, because the mind, and the way that it processs information, not count, one, two, three fingers. it's called them.
but that's not everything. isn't it? and then open your hand.
obviously the knife is holding there, not through magnetism, but through a trick, it's holding it to me.
and then when i close the slide, the same thing, as i retreat, the motion covered in a kind of retbbing my finger.
i'm eating my hand. and knife.
this trick you can make friends and neighbors. walking.
now, what about the placebo effect?
i read a study with a year ago, which opened my mind.
i'm not a scientist, so for me that was something amazing.
it turns out that if you manage a placebo pill form of a white pill, just a white pill, just a white pill, has a certain measured effect.
but if you change the shape where you give it a little bit smaller pill, you make it blue and left on it a letter, it has a greater measured effect.
although none of these pills have pharmaceuticals--they're sugar pills.
but the blue pill is not as good as the blue one.
how? that left me a mask.
and yet it turns out it doesn't stop there.
if you take the capsules, they're more effective than the tablets, any form.
a colored sheet, yellow capsula in one end and red at the other is better than the white capsule.
and dozaj is a thing.
a pill twice a day is not as good as three--don't remember the study now. sorry.
but the idea is like--
--and dozaj matters.
and even the shape has something to do with that.
and if you want the hardest placebo, you need to go to the needle.
yeah? a syringe with something inert--some cubic centimeters of something inert, and you inject this in a patient. . .
so it's such a powerful image for them, much stronger than the white pill.
it's real, this chart, well, i'm going to show you another time i'll have slides.
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue is not as good as a capsule, and it's not as good as a needle.
and there's no real pharmaceutical quality.
it's just our confidence to do it in our body and produce more powerful effect.
and i wanted to see if i could apply this to a magic trick.
and let me take something that's obviously a fake trick and make it look real.
and we know from that study that if you want reality, you have to use the needle.
this is a seven-toly hat. it's very sharp.
and i'll delete it a little bit.
that's my hand. there's nothing artificial.
this is my skin. there's no special hollywood effect.
i'm going to shake my skin, and i'm going to start with this needle.
if you're sensitive--if you're horrified--i was doing this for a few friends in the hotel room, and there were some people i don't know, and a woman near lesinating.
so, i'm suggesting that if you're quickly going to look at you elsewhere in the next few minutes--in fact, you know what, i'm not going to do the first part of view.
you'll see, you're going to look elsewhere if you will.
so, this is, right here, at the bottom of my arm, i'm going to make a little hole.
i'm sorry.
and now i get the needle through the skin, and i'm going to take it on the other side like this.
now, we're pretty much at the same point as the knife trick.
that's something like that.
but now you can't count my fingers, right?
well let me show you. look one, two, three, four, five.
yeah, all right.
i know what people think when they see this.
" i say, " " well, it's not so bad that it's going to be happy to enjoy us a few minutes, " " well, look a little bit. "
what does this look like? pretty good.
" yeah, i know. and those of you in the back will say, " " okay. i actually didn't see that, " " those in the room right next to now. "
let me show you better.
this is really my skin. there's no special effect from hollywood.
this is my meat, and i can laugh it.
sorry. if you go wrong, look elsewhere, don't look at that.
" those of you in the back or those of you who are going to look over years on the video will say, " " e, okay, it looks pretty clean is a thing there, but if it were real, it should--if it's got a hole there, if it's real
ready, here we go.
normally, now i would take the needle.
i would shake my hand, and i would like to show you i didn't have any wounds.
but i think in this context, and with the idea of taking something false and turned it into something real, i'll leave it there, and i'll leave it off the stage.
we see ourselves a few times these days.
i hope you would expect. thank you very much.
so i met a lot of fish in my life.
i loved just two.
the first one was more like a passionate business.
it was a beautiful fish, full of taste, texture, cardboard, a star of the menu.
what fish.
even better, it was raised to a farm in, it turns out, the highest standard of sustainability.
so you could feel good when you sell it.
i was in a relationship with this beauty on the duration of many months.
one day, the director of the company called me and asked me if i was talking about a event about sustainable sustainability.
" " " of course, " " i said. "
here's a company trying to solve what has become this unimaginable problem for our boss kitchen.
how do we keep the fish on our menus?
for the last 50 years, i fishing in sea and oceans as i deforested the forests.
it's hard to overestimate destruction.
90 percent of the big fish, the one we love, the tone, the halibut, the somon, the sabie fish, they all collapsed.
they almost disappeared.
so, for good or at the river, the fish farms, become part of our future.
there's a lot of controversy about acvaculture.
the farms across pollution, at least most of them do, and they have reduced productivity, you see the tone.
a major deficiency.
the tone has a 15-to-one conversie rate.
what that means is it needs 15 pounds of wildlife to get a delivery of tuna growing on the farm.
it's not too sustainable.
and also, it doesn't taste too pleasant.
so, finally, there was a company trying to do it well.
i wanted to support her.
on the day before the event i called the chief of public relations in the company.
let's call it don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " just to put things at the point, you're news because you're growing fish so far apart, you don't pollinate. " " "
" " " right, " " he said. " " we're so far away that the waste from our fish are diluate, they're not focused. " " "
" then he added, " " we're actually a new world. "
" food's consent rate? 2.5 to one, " " he said. "
" " " the best in the market. " " "
2.5 to one, great.
" " " 2.5 to one? what is food doing? " " "
" " " sustainable proteins, " " he said. "
" " " great, " " i said, " " i've done. i've done the auction. "
and that night, i was in bed and i thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein?
so the next day, just before the event, i called it don.
" i said, " " don, give me some sustainable protein examples, " " he said he didn't know. i'll ask you. "
well, i spoke to the phone with a few people in the company.
none of them could give me a clear response.
finally, i spoke to the chief biologist.
let's call him el don.
" " " don, " " i said, " " give me some sustainable protein examples, " " well, he mentioned some algae and something famous fish, and then he said the chickens. "
" i said, " " chickens? " " "
" he said, " " yeah, the pene, the skin, the famous bone, resturi, dry and processed in food. " " "
" i said, " " what percentage of your food is chicken? " " "
thinking, you know, about two percent.
" " " well, it's about 30 percent, " " he said. "
" " " don, what's sustainable in feeding your cave with chicken? " " "
" it was a long break on the line, and he said, " " i'm just too many chicks in the world. " " "
my love for this fish was wrong.
no, not because i would be a particularly virtuous mouth and ipocrit.
in fact, i'm actually.
no, i felt wrong by this fish because, around god, after that conversation, the fish had tasted.
second fish, it's another kind of love story.
it's the kind of romantic, the kind of in which, the better you know the fish, the more you love it.
you know, i eat him at a restaurant in southern spain.
a journalist friend spoke for a long time about this fish.
and in a way, it showed us the meeting.
it came to the table in a white, bright black, almost sclipitoation.
the head kitchen has cooking too much.
about twice.
surprisingly, it was still delicious.
who can make a fish to have good taste after it was cooking too much?
i can' t, but this guy can.
let's call it miguel.
in fact, his name is actually miguel.
and no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not the head chef.
at least not how you and i understand that.
he's a biologist at the palm.
it's a cat farm in the southwest corner of spain.
it's at the age of the guadalquivir.
by the 1980s, the 1980s was in the hands of argentinieans.
they were growing cattle in the area that was actually a swamp.
they created it through the dread of the land.
they built this series of complicated channels, and they pushed water outside the areas back to the river.
but they couldn't do it economic work.
and ecological was a disaster.
he killed 90 percent of the birds, which for this place meant a lot of birds.
so in 1982, a spanish company with ecological consciousness bought the land.
what did they do?
they reversed the meaning of water.
they switch to their own.
instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to bring water back.
they flooded the channels.
they created a cat farm by 11000 hectares--biban, babusc, shrimp, print--and in this process miguel and his company, completely deleted the effects of eco-friendly destruction.
farm is incredible.
i mean you haven't seen anything like that.
you holbe to the horizon that's at millions of miles away, and everything you see are flooding and swampy earth, often rich.
i was there not long ago with miguel.
he's a great guy, three parts of charles darwin and some dundee crocodile.
okay? so here's where it's hard to go through the swamp, and i'm measurable and transpir, i have mush up to knees, and miguel is holding their biology lesson.
here's a black shadow here.
now they mention mineral needs of fitoplanctoon.
and here he sees a pattern in groups that reminded his tanzanian giraffe.
we found miguel spent most of the career in the middle of the honey national park in africa.
i asked him how to become an expert in fish.
" he said, " " fish? i didn't know anything about fish. "
" i'm an expert in relationships. " " "
and then there's more discussions about rare birds and algae and strange water plant.
and don't get me wrong, it was really fascinating, you know, kind of a biological community.
it was great, but i was lovely.
and i was lesinated after that piece of fish over delicious, ready too much, which i consumed at the previous night.
" so i interrupted it. i said, " " miguel, what makes your fish be so loud? " " "
he showed up to algae.
" " " yeah, i know, filfizonule, algae, fitoplancton, relationships, is amazing. "
but what do you eat your fish?
" what is the consent rate of feeding? " " "
well, it started telling me that it's such a rich system, that fish eats what would eat and salbatacie.
plant biomass, fitoplankton, zooplankton, that feeds the fish.
the system is so healthy, it completely reinventing itself.
it's not necessary for another food.
have you ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed their animals?
" later on that day, i was driving the car through this property of migration, and i said, " " for a place that seems so natural, " " unlike any other farm i've ever been, " " how do you measure your success? " " "
at that point, it was like the filmmaker of a film would have asked to change the difference.
and i got the corner, and i saw the most amazing view, thousands and thousands of flamingo pink birds, a real pink covor.
" " " this is success, " " he said. "
" " " look at their pink burties. "
" it's ospatetes. " " "
ospat? i was completely undesirable.
" i said, " " miguel, but they don't ospatete from your fish? " " "
" " " yes, " " he said. "
" " " we're losing 20 percent of our fish and the icrele fish because of birds. "
well, last year, this property had 6, 000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
" today has become the biggest and one of the most important sanctuary of birds in all europe. " " "
" i said, " " miguel, is there a population of birds' population is not the last thing you want on a fish farm? " " "
he's crazy his head, no.
" he said, " " we're growing the fish, not intensive fish. "
this is an ecological network.
flamingo birds eat the shrimp.
shrimp eats fitoplancton.
" so the more pink, the better the system. " " "
all right, let's recapitulate.
a farm that doesn't feed their animals, and a farm that measures their success through their own dust animals.
a fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.
oh, by the way, those flamingo birds shouldn't even be there.
they're growing in a 240 kilometers away, where the soil conditions are better at building their nests.
every morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm.
and every night, they fly 240 kilometers back.
they do that because they're able to track the blue line of the fourth2 sauce.
it's not a joke.
i would imagine something like penguin march, so i looked at miguel.
" i said, " " miguel, they fly 240 kilometers to the farm, and then they fly 240 kilometers back at night? "
" they do it for their chickens? " " "
he looked at me as if i was quoted from a song of whitney houston.
" he said, " " no. i do it because food is better. " " "
i didn't mention the skin of my iubit fish, who was delicious, and i don't like my fish skin.
i don't like cake. i don't like crunch.
it's got that unpleasant taste like a gudron.
when i cook, i'm going to get it almost every time.
however, when i've tasted it to that restaurant in southern spain, it didn't have any fish leather.
he had a sweet and clean taste as if you had taken an ocean fly.
i mentioned this to miguel and he lean.
" he said, " " the skin acts as a sponge. "
it's the last defense in everything that goes into the body.
" it evolved to absorb their bodies. " " "
" and then he added, " " but our water has no bodies. " " "
all right. a farm that doesn't feed their fish.
a farm that measures its success through the success of their own prey.
and then i understood when he said, a farm that doesn't have immortality, he has a lot of stuff, because the water that flows through the farm comes from the guadalquivir river.
it's a river that brings up all the things that rivers tend to bring in these days, chemical impurities, fish spawn.
and when he's making his way through the system and he leaves it, the water is cleaner than at the entry.
the system is so healthy that it wore water.
so, not just a farm that doesn't feed their animals, not just a farm that measures their success through your own threshold animals, but a farm that's really a use of water pursuing, not just for those fish, but also for you and also for me.
because when water goes around, she came back to the atlantic ocean.
a drop in the ocean, i know, but i'm looking at it, and that's what you should do, because this story of love, though romantic, is also instructive.
you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, regardless of biban or cattle.
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture, one in which food has good taste.
but for a lot of people this is a little bit too radical.
new mouths are not realistic.
we're lovely.
we love farmers' markets.
we love small farms.
we're talking about local food.
we eat organic.
" and when you suggest that these are things that will provide the future of good food, somebody somewhere lifts up and says, " " hey man, and i love the flamingo pink birds, but how are you going to feed the world? "
" how are you going to feed the world? " " "
can i be honest?
i don't like that question.
no, not because we already produce more calories than it takes for the world.
one billion people are going to be flake today.
a billion--that's more than ever before--because of great inequalities in distribution, not because of quantity.
now, i don't like this question because it led the logic of our food system over the last 50 years.
" feed the grasslands with the border, treating the monopolys with pesticides, put chemicals into the soil, and all of the agrarian ask the whole question, " " how bad can we be if we feed more people with less money? " " "
this was the motivation.
it was justification.
it was the plan of american agriculture business.
we should say it, a liquid business, a business that erodess the ecological capital that makes that production possible.
this is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
our bread basket is threatened today not because of the declines in the decline, not by the invention of the last tractor or the silence, but the lack of the fertilizer, not pumping water, not the lack of fresh water, not the lack of the chains, but the lack of forests,
do you want to feed the world?
let's say, how are we going to feed ourselves?
or better, how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed themselves?
to do that, don't look at the agricultural business model in the future.
it's very old, and it's periphery.
they consume a lot of capital, chemistry and cars, and never produced something good to eat.
instead of looking at the eco-model.
this is the one that is based on billions of years of experience at workplace.
look at miguel, farmers like miguel, farms that aren't fighting for themselves, farms that restore, farms that are growing extensive instead of just intensive, farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships, because they are those who are experts in tastes.
and if i really wanted to be honest, they're better kitchens than i'm ever going to be.
you know, i'm walking with this, because if that's the future of good food, she'll be delicious.
thank you.
i grew up with a constant science fiction diet.
at high school, i was walking with the bus at school a city and come back every day.
and i was always absorbed by a book, a fantastic scientific book, who was wearing my mind to other worlds and satisfy me in a narrative form, this sense of curiosity that i had.
" and you know--that curiosity also manifests in the fact that whenever i was at school, i was out, by the forests, walking around and walking" " samples, " " frogs and snakes and cockroaches and heletations water, and i brought them back,
i was a really nerds in science.
but it all had to do with my attempt to understand the world, to understand the limits of possible.
and my passion for scientific science--fantastic seemed to be found in the world around me, because of what's going on--this was going on in the late 60s--i was going to go to the moon, we explore the deep oceans.
jacques cousteau came to our living room with amazing emission that showed us animals and places from a fantastic world that we couldn't imagined before.
so, this seemed to be resonated with all of the scientific scientific--fantastic.
and i was an artist.
i could draw. i could paint.
and i discovered that because there were no video games, and this cg movies, and all of this picture of images in the media landscape, i had to create these images in my head.
you know, we all had to, as kids have to read a book, and through the description of the author, put something on the cinema screen from the launtlogy of our heads.
and so my answer to all of this was to draw, paint creatures and alien worlds, robots, spacecraft, all of these things.
i was always caught at the mathematics of doodling on the dog.
that's because this is because this creativity had to find themselves, somehow, a way of getting out.
and it was an interesting thing, jacques cousteau's shows me very excited about that there was a alien, alien, right here on earth.
i could not really go into a alien world in a space ship ever.
this dream seemed pretty unbelievable.
but that was a world where i could really go, right here on earth, and this was as rich and exotic as anything i imagined reading those books.
so i decided i would become a dive at age 15.
and the only problem with this was that we were living in a little satuc in canada, 600 miles away from the nearest ocean.
but i didn't let that intimidated me.
i slept my father until he found, finally, a short classroom class in buffalo, new york city, just near the border, almost where we were living.
and i actually became a dividing dive in a small pool in the middle of the winter in buffalo, new york.
and we didn't see the ocean, a real ocean for another two years, when we moved to california.
since then, over the course of 40, i spent about 3, 000 hours underwater and 500 of those hours were in submarine.
and we learned that that deep deep environment, and even less deep oceans are so full of life, that it's really beyond what we can imagine.
nature imagination is so quiet, compared to ourselves, poor human imagination.
i'm totally amazed by what i see when i do these dives.
and my love story with the continuing ocean, and it's as strong as it was always.
but when i picked a career, as an adult, that was the film.
and this seemed to be the best way to reconcile this need that i had to tell stories with the need to create images.
and as a child, we're constantly drawing comicss, and so on.
so, the creation of films was the way to put images and stories together. and that made sense.
" and of course, the stories i chose to say were scientific science--fantastic stories: " " terminator, " " " " aliens" " and" " abisul. " " "
" and with" " the slaughter, " " i've got my love for underwater landscape and dive with film creatures. "
by combining these two passions.
" there's something interesting about" " abisul, " " which is solving a narrative narative problem that film, which is creating this liquid being in the water, for which i hug embraced the computer, cg. "
and this led to the first character that ever appeared in a movie.
and even though the movie didn't make money, i should say that she had just won the investment, i was witnessed to something great, which is that the audience, the global audience, was hypnotized by this magic.
you know, it's arthur clarke's law that any advanced technology is impossible to be made of magic.
they saw something magic.
and so, that made me become very excited.
" and i thought, " " wow, that's something that needs to be adopted in art cinematografica. " " "
" that's why, in" " terminator 2, " " which was my next movie, i took this a lot further. "
working with ilm, we created the lichid metal in that movie, the success depends on how this special effect would work.
and it worked. and we created magic again.
and we had the same result with the audience.
i did a little bit more money on this.
so by pulling a line between these two experiences, it's kind of a new world, a new form of creativity for film artists.
in conclusion, i put a company with stan winston, my good stan winston friend, which is creative designers and costume at that time, and i called it a digital domain.
and the idea behind the company was that we're going to jump over the analogic processes of optics and so on and so forth, we'll go straight into digital production.
and we did that, which gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
but i went back to the late' 90s in terms of design of creation and characters, which was actually the company that company had been given.
" and i wrote this piece called" " avatar" " who had the role of pushing things beyond visual effects, computer effects on the computer and more, with human characters of emotion, generate in cg. "
and the main character was going to be completely generated in cg.
and the world was going to be all cg.
but plans didn't work.
and people at my company told me that we couldn't do that for a while.
so, i put the idea of the pastration, and i did another film about a big boat going down.
" you know, i went and presented it to the studio as" " romeo and juliet on a ship. " " "
it was going to be a romantic story of epic proportion, a passion.
in secret, what i wanted to do was to dive me down to research the real epava of the titanic.
and that's why we did the movie.
this is the truth. well, the studio didn't know that.
" but i convinced them. i said, " " we're going to dive out. we'll filmed it on good. "
we're going to use this at the beginning of the movie.
" it's going to be very important. it's going to be a great deal of marketing. " " "
and i convinced them to fund an expedition.
it sounds crazy. but it has to do with that subject that your imagination can create a reality.
because we actually created a reality where six months later, i found myself in a russian submarin two and a half under the level of the north atlantic, looking at the real titanic through a hublou, not a movie, not hd, right.
now, that fascinated me.
and it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things like this, but it struck me how much this dive, this deep dive was similar to a space mission.
you know, where everything was strong technological, and that was extremely planning.
you go into this capsule, you lean into this dark and hostile environment where there is no hope to be saved if you can't go back to yourself.
" and i thought, " " wow. i was living in a fantastic scientific film. "
" this is indeed cool. " " "
and so i was really beaten by the mania exploration of the oceans.
of course, by curiosity, by the scientific thing.
it was everything. it was adventure, it was curiosity. it was imagination.
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me.
because, you know, i could imagine a creature, and i could create a visual effect for her. but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing through that hublou.
while i was doing some of the external expeditions, i would see creatures at hydrothermal ventilators and sometimes things that i never saw before, sometimes things that no one ever saw before, which weren't described by science at the time we see and photographed them.
so, i was completely trying to do this, and i had to have more.
so i took a pretty curious decision.
" after the success of the titanic, i said, " " i'm going to put a break of hollywood producer--ian de videos and i'm going to become a whole time explorer. " " "
and so we started to plan these expeditions.
and we ended up going to bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles.
we went back to the titanic.
i took little robots that i had created has am bobinat fibra optic.
and the idea was to go inside and make a interior exploration of ships, which hasn't done before.
no one looked inside the epration. they didn't have the means to do this, so we created technology to do this.
so, you know, i'm on the deck of the titanic, in a submarine and looking at the floor that looked a lot like the ones i knew that he was playing the orchestra.
and i'm controlling a little robotic vehicle through the ships.
when i say, i control it, but my mind is in that vehicle.
i felt like i was physically physically present inside the titanic age.
and it was the most jerusalem in common already vu experience that i ever had, because i knew before i went through a corner of what's going to be there before the lights of the vehicle to reveal it, because i was walking around the stage months when we create the movie.
and the stage was built as an exact replica of the boat plan.
this was a remarkable experience.
and it really made me realize the telepresence that you can have with these robotics avatars, when your consciousness is injected in a vehicle, in this form of existence.
it was a profound thing.
and maybe a quick look at what might happen over a few decades, as we're going to start having cyborg body for exploration or for other goals in many of the kinds of post-human futures that i can imagine that the fan of science fiction.
so by doing these expeditions and starting to appreciate what we've discovered there, down, like these income zones in the deep ocean, where we discovered these amazing animals.
they're essentially aliens that live right here on earth.
they live in a chemical synthesis environment, they don't survive in a solar light system, so we.
so you see animals living next to water jets with 500 degrees.
you think it could not survive.
at the same time, i was very interested in the science of space, again, the scientific influence--the fantastic i've experienced at the time of childhood.
and i found myself involved in the community of interest in nasa, by doing some of the nasa consultant council, plans on real space missions, going to russia, going through the biomedical protocols for pre-cosmonauti and all these things, to really go and fly to the international space station with
and that was fascinating.
but what i ended up doing is to bring people to the space with us in the deep.
and to drive them down because they have access, astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments, taking them in the deep, and let them see and get samples to test instruments, and so on.
so here we are doing documentaries, but we actually look at, we create space science.
i completely closed the circle of being a scientist--fantastic, you know, as a kid, and doing these things on good.
i learned a lot about science. but i also learned a lot about art to drive.
now, you would think that the region has to be a leader, the leader, the captain, and all of these things.
i really didn't really learn about art to drive until i did these expeditions.
" because i had to, at some point, say, " " what am i doing here? "
" why do i do that? what do you win from that? " " "
we don't make money with these non-missions.
we just survive. they don't bring any kind of fame.
" people kind of think i've left between" " titanic" " and" " avatar" " and i was doing my fingertips somewhere sitting at the beach. "
we did all these films, we did all these documents for a very limited audience.
no fame, no glory, no money. what do you do?
you do it for the work itself, for the challenge--and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exist, for the emotion of discoveries and the strange connection that form when a small group of people form a tight team.
because we were doing these things with a 10-12 team, working for years.
sometimes it's two to three months old.
and in this connection, you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have for them and they have for you, that you did a job you can't explain someone else.
" when you go back to the shoreline and you say, " " we had to do this, and fiber optics, and atenuation, all the technology that has been involved, and the difficulty of human performance to work on the sea, you can't explain people. it's that thing that
it creates a connection, it creates a respect connection.
" so, when i went back to doing my next movie, which was" " avatar, " " i tried to apply the same principle to drive, which is to respect your team and win them at the same time and their respect. "
and it really changed dynamic.
" and here i am again with a small team, the unknown territory, doing" " avatar, " " invent new technology, who don't exist until. "
amazingly interesting.
great challenging.
and i became a family, over a four-and-a-half-year period.
and that changed all my way to make films.
so people have comenced the way, well, you know, brought to life of oceanic organisms and put them on the pandora planet.
for me it was more fundamental to do business, the process itself, that changed as a result of this.
so, what can we synthesize from that?
you know, what are lessons learn?
well, i think the first is curiosity.
it's the most powerful thing you have.
imagination is a force that can really manifest in reality.
and the respect of your team is more important than everybody in the world.
" the young makers of films come to me and say, " " give me a advice to do that. " " "
" and i tell them, " " don't limit yourself. "
other people will do that for you, don't do it alone, don't bet against you.
" and take risks. " " "
" nasa has this favorite phrase: " " failure is not an option. " " "
but failure has to be an option in art and exploration, because it's a trust issue.
and no important trial that asked innovation has not done without risk.
you have to be willing to drop those risks.
so, this is the thought that i leave you with, that in whatever you do, failure is an option, but fear, no. thank you.
i would like to leave you with one important idea today, which is that the whole amount of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts, and instead of thinking about overlapping with information i would rather think about how we can use information so that we can see patterns and see the trends that
now we're looking at the ordinary mortality graph organized after the age.
the program i use here is experimental, it's called pivot, and what i can do with it is i can filter a certain cause of death, accidents for example.
immediately, i see another structure, differently.
because, here in the middle, people are in their most active period, and this is because they become very fragile.
we're doing a step back and we're showing the data after death, and we see that the disease of circulatory and cancer are the tough suspects, but not for all.
if we continue and filtram after age, let's say 40 years or less, we see accidents are actually the most common cause to worry about people.
and further, it's particularly the case for men.
you realize that this kind of visualization of data, it's like swimming in a graphic graphic graph.
and if we can do this with simple data, why don't we do the same with the content?
here's the cover of every number in sports illustrated that has been printed before.
they're all here. they're all on the internet.
you can try this home when you go from here.
with pivot, you can look at certain periods.
then some years.
you can go directly to a particular subject.
i look at this--i see athletes that came up in this sport editie.
i'm a great fan lance armstrong, so i select it, and that brings me all the numbers where lance armstrong appeared.
" if i just wanted to look at them, maybe i'm going to go through my mind, " " what would i be to see what they're going to see about ciclism generally? " " "
i go back and open this.
i see greg lemond now.
and you understand that when you navigate through information in this way, when you're more generally, you go back and forth, don't look, you don't navigate.
you do something a little bit different.
it's somewhere in the middle, and we think it's changing the way information can be used.
i want to go a little bit further on this idea that's a little bit of a sonat.
i took every page in wikipedia and reduced it to a summarized.
the sum is just a short description and an iconet that indicates the field of which comes from.
i'm just showing you the first 500 most popular pages right here.
but even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
we immediately see what the main most popular subjects are on wikipedia.
now i'm going to select governance.
now that i chose government, i can see the category in wikipedia that correspond to the most frequently, which is time magazine--the personality of the year.
and that's important because it's something that was not content in no wikipedia page.
you can find that only if you do a step back and look at all at all simultaneously.
looking at all these particular summaries, i can then explore the concept of time magazine--the personality of year, bring them all over the surface.
and i look at these people, i see most of them come from government.
a few come from natural sciences.
a few, fewer, comes from business.
this is my boss.
and that comes from music.
and interestingly, bono is also a ted winner.
so we're going to look at the ted winner.
you see, we first navigate the web as though it really would be a network, not from the page in the page, but at a higher level of abstraction.
and i want to show you one thing that can take you through surprise.
i'm showing you the new york times site.
pivot, our application--i don't want to call it browser, because it's not a browser, but you can see web pages with it--and we use marire and small technology in every page.
i can step back, go back to a certain section.
why is important, because just accessing web pages in this way, i can see my whole search history in exactly the same way.
i can explore more in detail what i did in different times.
here's the situation of this demo we're doing now.
and i can look at the stuff i've done today earlier.
and if i want to step back and look at all i can disecfy my search history, for example.
here i looked for bing, here for live labs pivot.
and from here i can choose a page and launch it again.
it's a reusable metaphor many times, and every case makes the whole larger than the sum of the parts in the data.
now, in our world, we think data is a curse for us.
we're complaining about the over-over-over-information curse.
we say we suffocate our data.
what if we came back to the other way back and come back and the web, so instead of going from one thing to the next, we used to go from more to more things, and be able to find patterns that otherwise are hidden?
if we did that, instead of getting trapped into data traps, we could actually be able to extract information.
and instead of having a primary relationship with information, we could actually extract knowledge.
and if we extract knowledge, maybe it's also wisdom.
with that, thank you.
everybody talks about happiness today.
" i asked someone to count how many books that have the word" " happiness" " in title have been published over the last five years and quit about 40. there's a lot more. "
there's a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers.
there's a lot of counselor for finding happiness.
everyone wants to make people happier.
but despite numerous activities in this area, there are some cognitive trap that prevents us to make a clear picture of happiness.
my talk today's talk is going to be able to read in these cognitive traps.
they're so true to ordinary people who think about their happiness and researchers studying the concept of happiness, apparently we're as confused as everyone else.
the first of these heads is the reticent to admit the complexity of happiness.
" it turns out that the word" " happiness" " is no longer a word because we use it too many different things. "
there's probably a specific sense that we could restrange, but generally, we're going to have to give up this notion and adopt a more common vision of goodness.
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory: in fact, a confusion between being happy in life and satisfied in his own life or satisfied about his life.
there are two very different concepts, both in the notion of happiness.
and the third confusion is the illusion of perception, the fact that we can't think of no circumstances that affect the well-being without distorted the importance.
and this is a serious cognitive trap.
we just don't perceive it.
i'd like to start with an example of a person who's in a question of questions and answers at the end of my seminar told a random story.
he said listening to a symphony and that music had been absolutely great.
but at the end of the recording, there's been a terrible scary, and he added, quite affected, that the scartait had broke the whole experience.
it's actually not experiencing the experience, but the memory of experience.
he's living experience.
it's about 20 minutes of wonderful music.
but they were reduced to zero because what was left was memory.
the memory had been altered, and the memory was all left.
the conclusion here is that we probably perepete ourselves as entities with double self.
there's a self at the real time that remains in the present, and lives the present, capable of retreating the past, but basically it's just the present.
it's the self to talk about the doctor.
" you know, when the doctor asks, " " hurt when do you appear here? " " "
on the other hand, there's memory self, and memory self is the one that keeps driving and maintain the memory of our lives.
" it's the one who asks the doctor when they ask, " " how would you feel like the last time? " " "
" or" " how was the trip in albania? " " and so on. m. d. "
these two are very different entities, self-synergy and self-memory self, and the confusion of them leads to ambiguity to the notion of happiness.
memory self is a storyteller.
it starts with the basic answer of our memories, it starts immediately.
we don't tell stories only when we consciously tell stories.
our memory tells us stories, more precisely, what we're able to remember from our lives is a story.
let me start with an example.
there's an old study about patients that go through a painful experience.
not in the details. it's no longer painful today, but it was painful during the study in' 90s.
patients were asked to describe their pain every 60 seconds.
we have two patients here and their regulations.
" the question is, " " what suffered more? " " "
it's a very simple question.
obviously the patient b suffered more.
his colonoscopy took more, has gone through every minute of pain that he went through and the patient, even more.
" but here's another question, " " how did these patients have perceived? " " "
and here we have a surprise: the surprise is that the patient remained with a much more unpleasant memory about colonoscopy than the patient b.
the memory of these colonoscopies were different because a crucial part of the story is how it ends up.
none of those stories are memorable or grandious but one of them. but one of them is obviously more unpleasant than the other one.
and the worst was that pain was more intense to the end.
it's an unpleasant story.
how do we know?
i asked these people after colonoscopy, much later, how unpleasant it was.
in their memory, it was much more unpleasant for the patient than for b.
it's a direct conflict, between the self and the self of memory.
from the experimental self's point of view, it's clear that the b patient suffered more.
what we could do with the patient, and we actually did clinic experiments, which worked, is to take the colonoscopy of the patient holding the tube without moving it too much.
that's going to make the patient suffer, but slightly, much less than ever before.
if we do that for about two minutes, we're doing this about the experience of the moment of the patient's moment, but we improve the self of the memory, because now we've left the patient with a better memory of his experience.
what does a story define?
and it's true for the stories that we provide memory, but also for the stories we invent.
which defines a story are changes, meaningful moments and end.
the end is very, very important.
in this case, the end of it was determined.
the self at times lives their content.
does it have successful moments of living, and you ask, what's going on with these moments?
and the answer is very simple.
they're lost forever.
most of the moments of life--and we calculated: psychologists present, it says it takes about three seconds.
it means that in a life, we have about 600 million moments of time.
one month we have about 600, 000.
most of them don't leave it.
most of them are completely ignored by memory self.
and yet, we have the impression that we should matter, that what's going on in these moments of living is our lives.
it's the finite resource that we consume during our existence on earth.
and the way we spend it should be relevant, but that's not the story that memory self keeps.
so we have the self of memory and the self, which are distinct.
the biggest difference between them is the way it's processed time.
from the point of view of the self, if you go to vacation and the second week is as good as the first one, the vacation vacation is twice as good as a week.
for memory self, things don't work at all.
for the memory's self-memory, a two-week vacation is better than a week vacation, because we don't add new memories.
the story hasn't changed.
so time becomes essential variable that distinguishs self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-synergy.
duration has a reduced impact on the story.
the memory self doesn't only do to remember and tell stories.
it's actually the one that takes decisions because if a patient had, for example, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and decides to choose, the elected one will be the one whose memory is less unpleasant, because that's the thing that determines choice.
experimental self has nothing to say in this choice.
we don't actually choose between experience, but between experience memories.
and even when we think about the future, we normally don't think about the future as a set of experiences.
we think of our future as anticipated memories.
and essentially, you can consider this, as a tyranny of the self of memory, and you can consider the self of memory as something that pulls up after the experimental self through the experience that experimental self doesn't need.
i feel that when we go to vacation, and that's very often happening, that's where we go to vacante, in a very big deal, in the service of memory self.
and that's kind of hard to justify, it seems to me.
i mean, how do we consume our memories?
this is one of the things that explains the dominance of memory.
and when i think about it, i think of a vacation i spent in antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the most beautiful vacation i had, and i think of it quite often, as much as i think about other vacantes.
and i've probably consumed that three-week memories to say for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
if i ever had ever opened the 600 pictures, i would have spent another hour.
so, you know, on the one hand, three weeks, and on the other hand, the most an hour and a half.
there seems to be a discrepancy.
i may be a little bit through zgarcenia that i consume my memories, but even if you eat them in a greater measure, the question remains true.
why do we give so much important memory by compared to experience?
so, i'd like to think about a thought experiment.
imagine that at your next vacation, you know that at the end of all of your photos are going to be destroyed, and you're going to take a drug that causes amnesia so that you don't remember anything.
would you pick the same holiday?
and if you've run another vacation, there's a conflict between the experimental self and the memory self, and you've got to think about how to transmit this conflict, and it's actually not easy at all because if you take time as criteria, you'll have an answer.
and if you take memories like criteria, you may have another answer.
why do we choose the vacuums that we choose?
it's a problem where we face a choice between the experimental and the memory self.
the experimental self and the memory of memory are doing two different notions of happiness.
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one for each self.
so you can ask, how happy is the experimental self?
and on the other hand: how happy are the moments of the experimental self?
and they're all happy at all.
it's a pretty complicated process.
what are the emotions that can be measured?
and by the way, we're now to do a pretty well-contributed idea of the happiness of experimental self through time.
instead, happiness of self-memory self, it's a completely different thing.
it's not about how happy life lives their lives.
it's about how satisfaction as excitement as this person when it's thinking about his life.
it's a very different notion.
who doesn't make the distinction between these notions, will compromise the study of happiness, and i belong to a group of scientists of goodness that have compromise the study of happiness for a long time.
the distinction between the happiness of the experimental self and satisfaction of the memory self has been recognized over the last few years, and they're now doing efforts to measure both separate them.
the gallup organization makes a world opinion survey where more than half a million people were asked about what they believe about their lives and their experiences.
and they were also done other effort.
so over the last few years we started learning some things about the two kinds of happiness.
and i think the main lesson i learned, is that they're really different.
you can know how satisfaction are with their lives, and that really doesn't really indicate a lot about how happy they are in their lives, and vice versa.
" just to give you an example of correlation, correlation is about 0.5 means if you meet someone and you say, " " oh his father is tall than 1.80 meters, " " how much did you know about the height of this person? "
well, you knew something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty you have so much uncertainty.
if i told you somebody has evaluated his life on eight to 10, you had a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with experimental self.
so correlation is small.
we know something about what it controls the satisfaction of the self of happiness.
we know money are very important, goals are very important.
we know that happiness means rather to be satisfied with people who like us, spend time with people who liked.
there are other pleasure, but they're too intense.
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two self, you'll get to do different things.
the conclusion of what i said here is the girl that we should not think about happiness as a substitution for well-being.
it's a completely different notion.
now, very quickly, another reason why we can't think of simplistic about happiness is that we don't mean the same things when we think about life and when we actually live.
so if you ask a simple question about how happy people in california are not going to get to the answer right.
when you ask this question, you would think that people have to be happier in california if, for example, you live in ohio.
and what's happening is that when you think about the living in california, you think of the contrast between california and other places, and the fact that this contrast is, for example, climate.
but it turns out that climate is actually not very important for the experience itself, and it's not very important for the reflective self that decides how happy people are.
however, because the reflective self is at leadership you could get--some people could get to move to california.
and it's interesting to watch what's going to happen to people that move into california hoping that they're going to be happier.
so their experimental self will not become happier.
we know that.
but one thing will happen. they will think they're happier.
because when they're thinking about it, they'll remember how horrible it was in ohio, and they'll feel they've taken good decision.
it's very difficult to think about well-being, and i hope i've offered a picture of how difficult it is.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. i have a question for you.
thank you very much.
a few weeks ago, when i spoke to the phone, you mentioned the fact that you got an interesting result in the gallup opinion survey.
do you think you can share that given that you still have a few minutes?
daniel kahneman: sure.
i think the most interesting result of gallup polls is a number that we didn't expect to get.
what we've learned about the happiness of the experimental self.
we looked at how the feelings are related to income.
and it turns out that under a 60, 000 dollars per year, americans, and that's a great number of interogati americans, about 600, 000, which is a great sample, under a income of 600, 000 dollars a year--
ca: 60, 000.
dk: 60, 000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become more unfortunate, as they become poor above this level, we get a flat line.
i mean, i rarely saw such a line.
it's clear that money doesn't bring the happiness of the experimental self, but the lack of them brings unhappiness, and we can measure this very, very accurate unhappiness.
in terms of the other self, the memory self, we have to do with another situation.
the more money you have, the more you are.
this is not true in the case of emotions.
ca: but danny, all the american dream is about life, freedom, search for happiness.
if the world would take this discovery seriously, i mean, everything seems to be on everything we think, for example, fiscal politics and so on.
is there any chance that political people, as the state in general, to take such an opportunity and to elaborate politics in the public based on it?
dk: you know, i think there's a recognition of the role of happiness in public politics.
the recognition will be slow in us, unindoielnic, but in the uk, it's happening, and in other countries.
people realize that they should think of happiness when they think about public politics.
it's going to take some time, and the world will debate if they want to study experimental happiness, or if they want to study the rating of life, so we have to have this debate pretty soon, because to improve happiness, there are different ways, depending on how we think, and
this is going to influence politics, i think, in the next years.
in us, they're doing experimental happiness in terms of the experimental happiness of people, i think, in the next two decades, some of the national statistics that: it turns out that this subject is going to be, or at least, the most interesting debate of watching over the years.
thank you very much for being invented behavioral economics.
thank you danny kahneman.
i'm going to talk about energy and climate.
and this may seem a little bit surprising because my entire work at the foundation is related to vaccines and seeds, of things we need to invent and deliver to help the poor two billion live better.
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people, even more important than anyone else on the planet.
climate change means that many years of crops are not going to grow.
it's going to be too much rain, it's not going to be enough rain.
things will change in ways that their fragile environment just can't fall in.
and that leads to hunger. it leads to uncertainty. it leads to nervous.
climate change will be terrible for them.
also, the price of energy is very important for them.
in fact, if we could choose one thing to get them down the price to reduce poverty, we've run away from energy.
well, the price of energy has reduced over time.
right, the advanced civilization is based on energy progress.
the coal revolution powered the industrial revolution, and right in the 1990s of the price of electricity has known a rapid decline, and that's why we have fridge, air conditioning, we can create modern materials and doing so much things.
and so we're in a wonderful situation in terms of electricity in the rich world.
but once we do it cheaper--and let's try to do it twice as cheaper as we need to respect a new constraint, and this constraint has to do with co2.
co2 heats the planet, and the equation about co2 is really quite simple.
if we collect the amount of co2 emise, this leads to a temperature growth, and the temperature rise to some very negative effects.
the effects of the time, and perhaps worse, the indirect effects so that natural ecosystem cannot adapt these fast changes, and that's how you get to the collapse of the ecosystem.
now, the exact embodiment of koreans between the rise of co2 and the rise of temperature, and where there are positive reactors, there's still some kind of uncertainty, but not very big.
and there's certainly uncertainty about how severe these effects are going to be, but they're going to be extremely severe.
i asked people the brand scientist, on the line of rows: do we really have to get close to zero?
can't we reduce half or a quarter?
and the answer is that we won't get close to zero, the temperature will continue to grow.
so we have a big problem.
it's not all about a four-meter truck that has to go under a three-meter bridge, and that we could somehow be able to go through.
here we have something that needs to be reduced to zero.
well, we emits a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons.
for every american is about 20 tons.
for people in poor countries, it's less than a ton.
on average on the planet are about five tons for every man.
and somehow, we have to make changes that go down to zero.
he grew up.
only different economic changes have produced some stability, so we have to go from a rapid growth to decrease, and down to zero.
equation has four factors.
a little bit of breeding.
so, we have something on the left, co2, which we want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services that every person uses on average, average energy for every service and co2 on the unit of energy.
let's look at each of them and see how we can get to zero.
probably one of these numbers will have to come close enough to zero.
now, this is from high school algebra, but let's look at it.
first, we have the population.
now, the world is today 6.8 billion people.
this is about nine billion.
now, if we do a great job with new vaccines and healthcare services and reproductive health services, we might be able to decrease this with maybe 10 percent or 15 percent, but here we see a growth of about 1.3.
the second factor is the services we use.
this includes everything, the food we eat, clothing, television, warming.
these are very good things, and it's got rid of poverty means to provide these services almost everybody on the planet.
and it's a great thing for this number to grow.
in the rich world, maybe in the first billion, maybe we might be able to limit and use less, but every year, this figure, on average, will increase, so generally, the services offered every person will increase twice twice.
here's a very basic service.
do you have light in your home to read your home?
well, these kids don't have, so they go out and read their homework to light bulbs from stalpi.
and then efficiency, it's energy for every service, here's the end of something good news.
we have something that doesn't grow.
through different inventions and ways of lighting, through different kinds of cars, different ways of building buildings, there are many services where you can reduce energy for that substantial service, in the case of certain services, even by 90 percent.
there are other services, for example, how do we make fertilizer or making air transportation, where there's much less place for improving.
so on average, if we're optimistic, we might get a three-year reduction, maybe six times.
but for these three factors so far, we get from 26 billion, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that's not enough.
so let's look at the fourth factor--this is going to be a key factor--which is the amount of co2 emisa on the unit of energy.
and the question is: can we actually reduce it to zero?
if you burn coal, no.
if you burn natural gas, no.
almost every way to produce electricity today, except for emerging and nuclear methods, brought co2.
what we're going to need to do in the global scale, is to create a new system.
so, we need miracles of energy.
now, when i use the miracle term, i don't mean something that's impossible.
microprocessor is a miracle. the personal computer is a miracle.
his internet and services are a miracle.
people here have contributed to creating many miracles.
normally we don't have a term, so you can get a miracle to once.
normally just wait and some come, not.
this is a case where we really need to accelerate at the very maximum and get a miracle in a fairly short time.
i thought, well, how could i kill the idea?
is there any natural illustrates, about demo that could stimulate people's imagination?
i thought last year i brought mosquitos, and it turns out that some of them loved.
it really involved in the idea that, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.
well, with energy, all i could find was this.
i thought i'd go through a few fireflies, and that's my contribution to the environment here in this year.
so here we have some natural fireflies.
i was told that i couldn't fly. i actually may not even go out of the jar.
now, there's all kinds of tricky solutions like this, but they don't know who value.
we need solutions, one or more, who have an incredible scale, and they're big confidence, and although people are looking for many directions, i see only five that can produce big numbers.
i left the energy of the sea, geotermic, fusion, biofuels.
they may be able to contribute somebody, and if they want to get my expectations, the better.
but what i want to point out here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and that we can't give up any of them even if they seem overwhelmed, because they all present significant difficulties.
let's first look at burning fossil fuels or burning coal, or natural gas.
what we've got to do here, it's simple, but it's not, is to take the co2, after we burned it and out of the horn, presurize it, lichefiem, put it somewhere and hopefully stay there.
now we have some pilot stuff doing this at the 60 level to 80 percent, but growth to the percentage of plenty, that's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be hard to understand where to put these amounts of co2, but here's the hardest problem in the
who's going to be sure?
who's going to guarantee something that's literally about billion times greater than any kind of residents that you can think of, nuclear or another way?
it's a very large volume.
it's a hard problem.
next would be nuclear power.
she's got three big problems.
cost, especially in strict regularized countries, it's big.
the problem of security, to be quiet that nothing can happen, that even though there are these human operators, the fuel will not be used for weapons.
and then what do you do with the waste?
and, even if there's not a lot, we're concerned about that.
people need to feel good about this.
so there are three really heavy problems that might have solutions, and so we should work on them.
the last three of the five i put them together.
these are the ones that people call renewables.
but they even though it's great that they don't need fuel--they have some disadvantage.
one is that energy density produced by these technologies is much lower than a power plant.
these are energy farms, we're talking about many square kilometers, a thousand times larger than a normal power plant.
these are intermittances.
the sun doesn't shine all day, and it doesn't shine every day, and the wind doesn't leave it all the time.
if we depend on these sources, we need a way to get energy in that period when it's not available.
here's the big problem.
we have difficulties to transport.
for example, let's say a source of energy is out of the country, you don't just need technology, you need to examine you and risk to be able to be able to go from one another.
and finally, there's the embodiment problem.
and to understand the size, we took all kinds of batteries that are produced, for cars, computers, phones, lanterne, whatever.
we compared to the amount of energy that we consume the world, and we found that all the batteries that we're producing now could emphasize less than 10 minutes from total energy.
so, in fact, we need a significant progress here, a hundred times better than what we have now.
it's not impossible, but it's not easy.
this problem is when we want intermittances to be fish, say, 20 to 30 percent of consumption.
if we rely on it for 100 percent, we need a miracle battery.
well, how are we going to move on, what's the right way?
is it a manhattan project? what can we help us get there?
well, we need lots of firms to work on this, hundreds.
each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
and many of them are going to look and say they're crazy. that's good.
i think here in the ted group, we have a lot of people that are already on this road.
bill gross has a few companies, between which one called esolar, which has some excelente thermal solar technologies.
come on khosla invest invest in tens of companies doing remarkable things and interesting possibilities, and i try to support it.
nathan myhrvold and i actually support a company that maybe surprisingly, follow the nuclear path.
there are some innovation in nuclear field: modularity, liquid.
but innovation really stopped in this field a long time ago, so it wouldn't be surprising to exist some good ideas somewhere.
the idea of the terrapower is that instead of throwing some of the uranium, that one percent that's u235, we decided to burn the 99 percent of u238.
it's a pretty crazy idea.
it was actually talking about it for a long time, but it was never able to simulate how if it worked or not.
it's because of modern supercomputers now can simulate and see that, indeed, using the right materials, it turns out it would work.
and because the 99 percent is burned, the cost profile is much improved.
we actually burn the waste, and we can use fuel all the waste remains from today's reactors.
instead of worrying for them, we use them. it's a great thing.
inspired the uranium as it goes forward. it's like a candle.
" here's a kind of bustean, called" " progresive wave reactor. " " "
in terms of the fuel, that's really the problem.
i've got a picture of a place in kentucky.
these are wasted, the 99 percent remains after consumed the part that are burning now.
it's called the poor uranium.
cover the united states needs for hundreds of years.
and through the simple water filtration in a necostisitor process, we had enough fuel for the whole life of the planet.
so we're waiting for a lot of difficulty, but it's an example of many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward.
let's think, how can we evaluate?
what should our notes look like?
well, let's see where we need to get, and then look at the passions.
for 2050 you've heard a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction.
it's very important to get there.
and the 20 percent will be consumed by what's going on in poor countries and beyond agriculture.
hopefully we're going to be cleaning silviculture, civiculture.
to get to 80 percent, developing countries, including countries like china, they'll have to modify their electricity production.
the other note is if we apply this technology with zero emissions, if we put it into all the developing countries and we're in the rest of the world.
this is great important.
this is a key element in completaring the note meat.
we're doing a step back: what should the note report look like in 2020?
well, again, it should have two elements.
we should apply these effective measures to begin to get reductions.
the less we emits, the less co2 is going to be the amount of co2, and so, the lower temperature.
but in a sense, the note that we get, doing things that don't go to big reductions, is just equal or maybe even a little bit less important than the other, which is the innovation portion of these progress.
these progresss have to advise at the maximum speed, and that's what we can measure with companies, the pilot projects and regulation that have changed.
they wrote a lot of excellent books on this.
" al gore's book, " " our choice, " " and david mackay's book, " " sustainable energy, " " "
they take it all together and they create a structure so that people can talk about these things, because we need a broad support for that.
there must be a lot of things to be put together.
it's a wish.
it's a very concrete wish for us to invent this technology.
if i could just choose a wish for the next 50 years, i could choose who was president, i could pick a vaccine, which passionate me, or i could pick this: half a price energy, no co2.
i would choose it.
it has the greatest impact.
if we don't have this wish, the division between people who think shortrt and long term is going to be terrified, between the united states and china, between poor countries and rich countries, and particularly life of those two billion people will be much worse.
what do we need to do?
what do you want to do on you to do, and put it in motion?
we need more research funds.
when countries are meeting, for example, copenhagen, they shouldn't talk about co2.
it should talk about this kind of innovation plan.
they would surprise you how ridiculous little are spending for these innovative research.
it also requires market stimulus, taxa on co2, of stock markets, to hear the signal of prices.
we need to spread the message.
it has to be more rational, more wiser, including the measurements that the government takes.
it's an important wish, but i think we can do.
thank you.
thank you.
chris anderson: thank you. thank you.
thank you. to better understand about the terrapower, first of all, can you offer an idea of investment scale?
bill gates: to make software, buy supercomputer, hiring scientists, which i did, are only tens of millions.
even after we test the materials in a russian reactor to be sure that our materials work out, we'll just get hundreds of millions.
the hard part of this is the pilot reactor building, finding a few billion people, of authority, has handed the building of the first one.
after building the first one, if you go to the ad, then it's clear that the daylight, because the economy, energy density, are very different from the ordinary field in nuclear field.
ca: so to understand how we need, that's supposed to build in the ground, to the depth of a kind of nuclear fuel column, this type of uranium consumption, and then the process starts up and somehow go down?
bg: so it is. today all of you have to realize reactor that there are many people and lots of devices that can mistake, in that place where you open and move objects inside and outside.
that's not good.
if you have very cheap fuel you can let 60 years--we can look at it with a bustean, and you don't have the same complexity.
it's just sitting there and it burns for 60 years, and then it's ready.
ca: it's a nuclear power plant that is also our own waste-clear solution.
bg: yeah. well, what's going on with the waste, you can leave them there--there's a lot less waste in this way--and then you can actually take it and put it in another burning there.
and we start with the waste that exist today, now in cool cool basins or dry land in the reactive.
from this fuel we start.
the thing that's a problem for these reactors is really the first matter for ours, and we reduce the volume of waste waste through this process.
ca: but in the conversations with different people around the world about possibilities, where did you find the biggest interest to do something concrete?
bg: i didn't choose a precise place, and there's all these non-nuclear divided rules.
we're interested in a lot that people in the company went to russia, india, china.
i met here with the minister of energy and talked about this idea in energy agenda.
i'm optimistic. you know that french and japanese have done something.
this is a variant of something that has already done.
it's an important development, but it's like a rapid reactor and a lot of countries built them, so any of the countries that have built a rapid reactor can be in which the first one is going to be built.
ca: what do you think, when and what do you have to do is you do concrete?
bg: for one of the big electrical electrical generations that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent it and then 20 years to implement it.
this is the limiting term that environmental models have shown us that we need to respect.
and the terrapower, if things go well, what's a big wish, it could easily respect the term.
now, luckily, tens of companies, we need to be hundreds, which also, if their research works well, if funding for their pilot reactive works well, i can compete for that.
and it's best if i succeed more, because then we could combine things.
we need one to succeed.
ca: as possible changes on large scales, is this the biggest one you know?
bg: a energy revolution is the most important thing.
it would have been even without the environment limitations, but the environment limitations do it more significant.
in nuclear field, there are other innovators.
you know, we don't know them as well as this, but there are those who go to modularity, which is another way.
there's also a liquid reactor, which seems a little bit difficult, but maybe they also tell the same about us.
so there's a variety.
beauty is that a uranium molecule has a million times more energy than, say, one of coal.
so if we can solve the negative parts, which is essentially the radiation, then the ecological footprint, the cost, the potential, as effect on the land, and so on, the uranium is almost almost a classroom of one.
ca: but what if it doesn't work?
are we going to have to start taking emergency measurements to maintain the temperature of stable earth?
bg: if we get to this situation, it's like eating too much and you're on the point of having a heart attack.
what do you do? you can need heart surgery or something.
there's a direction of research in what's called geoenginerie, which is a different techniques that's beaten up to heating 20 or 30 years, until we organize.
but that's just an insurance police.
hopefully not need it.
some people say, we shouldn't even work on insurance polymers, because we could do our lazy, that we'll continue to eat because we know we'll save our heart surgery.
i don't think that's wise, given the importance of problems, but there's in geoenginerie, this talk, if we shouldn't hold the police in your pocket that things are precision or if this innovation goes far slower than we expect.
ca: climate skeptics: in a sentence or two, what would you tell them to convince them wrong?
bg: unfortunately, skeptics are different camps.
those of you who have scientific arguments are very few.
i say there's a lot of reaction effects of clouds that change things?
there are very, very few things i can tell.
they have a chance of a million to be right.
the main problem here is kind of like aids.
you do mistake now and you pay for it much later.
when you have all kinds of urgent problems, the idea is to support pain now to have a win later, and the pain is somewhat trying.
we actually have the ipcc report, which doesn't reflect the worst case, and there are people in the rich world looking at the ipcc, and they say, leave, it's not that big deal.
in fact, the uncertainty should be reasoning to do this.
" but my dream here is to get a economic yield and simultaneously respect the co2 limits, and then skeptics will say, " " okay, i don't care i don't really care that i wouldn't emits co2, but i'd accept it because it' s
ca: so this would be your answer to bjorn lomborg's argument, who says that if it consumes so much energy to solve co2 problem, it doesn't remain for the other goals, to try to escape the world of poverty, malaria and others, that we're wasted
bg: in fact, the spending spending for the research and development--let's say that the united states should spend 10 billion a year more than now--i'm not as dramatic.
there wouldn't be other things that are going on.
the thing you spend a lot, and here reasonable people can't agree, is when you try to finance something unprecedented.
this, for me, is largely wasted, beyond the situation when you're almost ready, and you just finance learning curves, and it's going to become very cheap.
i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper.
if we get to compromise to make super expensive energy, then richness can enable that.
any of us here may pay five times more on energy without changing our lifestyle.
disaster is for the two billion.
and even lomborg changed.
his position is: why don't it talk more about research?
because of the things in the past is associated with the camp of skeptics, but he realized he's a pretty lonely camp, so he put the problem of research.
it's a farama of something right, i think.
the research and development is a crazy how bad it is.
ca: bill, i guess i'm talking about the names of most here when i say i'm going to tell you that i'm going to come up with you. thank you very much.
bg: thank you.
i want to share with you a discovery a few months ago, while i was writing an article for wired italian.
when i write, i always have the dictionary to the food.
but i've already finished writing the article, and i realized that i never looked for the word disability in the dictionary.
let me read you the definition.
" " " disability, " " unfortunately, helpless, unfortunately, destroyed, stagnated, mutilated, swap, swap, olog, exhausted, exhausted, impotent, castrated, castrated, paralyzed,
you see hurt, useless and weak.
antonime: healthy, powerful, capable.
i read the list of a friend and i started laughing.
it was absurre.
" and after i went to" " scratch, " " he left me the voice and i had to stop and come back to my emotional shock. "
it was my old dictionary.
i thought maybe, maybe it was printed earlier.
but it came out of printing in the early' 80s, when i started elementary school, and i started to understand where i'm still stilldreded outside my family and how i report to other kids and the world around me.
thank god i didn't use a dictionary.
after this definition, it turns out i was born in a world who thought someone like me had no positive trait.
but today, i'm grateful for opportunities and adventures that my life took.
so, i immediately looked immediately in the online edit in 2009, hoping to find a major change.
here's the new version of definition.
unfortunately, there's nothing better.
" the last two words below" " almost antonime, " " i'm disturbing, " " and" " viguros. " " "
not just the words are the problem.
it matters what we think about the people we call this way.
it's about the values behind words and how we build them.
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and other people.
in fact, many ancient societies, including greeks and romanii, they thought a blestem on orale was very strong, because when you'd say it with loud voice, you had to exist.
so what is it that we want to create?
a person who has limitations or a strong person?
in fact, we call a man, a child, we may stop the power that it has.
wouldn't we better open a door?
a man who opened me a door was my childhood doctor, from the institute of a. i. dupont, from wilmington, delaware.
his name is dr. pizzutillo.
the american of italian origin, whose name seems to be too difficult to do american.
so he was telling his dr. p.
dr. p. always wears colorful, and she always needed to work with children.
i loved time at the hospital, except for physics therapy.
i had to do countless exercises with these heavy elastic elastic lanes, different colors, to support my feet from my feet.
we hate all of those comics.
we hate them.
although i was five years old, i was trying to convince dr. p. let me leave you to give up those exercise, of course, without any success.
one day, she came to my meeting. . .
--there were painful meetings and exhausted meetings. . .
" and she said to me, " " aimee, you're such a strong girl, " " that i think you're going to run one of these hairs. " " and when you're going to run it, i'm going to give you 100 dollars. " " this was the
but what he did was transforming a daily obligation into a new and promising experience.
and i'm also wondering what the measure of me said i'm a strong girl influenced the way i see me today, as a strong and athletes.
this is an example of how adults who have power can trigger the power of a child.
but through those definition of dictionary, our language is not allowing us to create the reality that we all want, the possibility of an individual to consider capable.
our language is not in power with changes of society, many of them being produced by technology.
of course, from a medical point, my feet, the laser surgery for vision, the knees of titan for knees and hips, that allow people to put their skills and overcome the limits of nature on them, so that we can't talk about social media platforms, that allow people to self-
maybe technology has now reveal us more clearly what was always true.
that every man has something rare and powerful to offer society, and that human ability to adapt is our biggest win.
the human ability to adapt is an interesting thing, because people always want to talk to them about the purchasing of adversity and i'm going to make you a confession.
i never liked this expression, and i responded to the people's questions about it.
i think i started to understand why.
implicit in the problem of adversitypasition is also the idea that success or happiness is about success of a heavy experience, not to be left by this, as if my successes in my life come from schools from schools to schools, or what others see that my disability.
but in fact, we're changing. we're obviously tagged by a physical or emotional challenge.
i want to suggest that this is a good thing.
adversity is not an obstacle that we have to overcome, so we can live our lives next.
it's part of our lives.
i think it's kind of my shadow.
sometimes i see it pretty much, sometimes it's less, but it's always with me.
i'm not trying to diminishing the impact of a person with adversity.
in life there are adversity and challenges for each of us, but the question is not whether you're going to meet this adversity, but the way you're going to react to it.
so our debt is not just protecting its adversity people who we love, but also to prepare them to fight.
we're making them a deserzing kids, when we make them feel uncapable to adapt.
there's an important difference between the medical that we have suffered a amputation and subjective opinion of society, if we or not disability.
and to be honest, the only real disability i've been dealing with was that the world thinks that i could have described by those definitions.
from our wish to protect those who we love, telling them the truth about diagnostic, or diagnostic about future quality of their lives, we have to be careful not to be the first to feel inferior.
that you just see what's wrong with you can be much more harmful than patology itself.
because we don't treat the person in the totality and we don't recognize them resilient, we transmit them another river over the other problems that he has.
we basically evaluate that human importance in society.
so we have to see the pathology of the things that a man is capable of.
and particularly, there's a partnership between those perceived deficiente and the biggest creative ability of ours.
we don't have to devalue these difficult moments, avoid them or move them, but to find the opportunities that adversity present.
the idea i want to point out is not only to overcome the adversity, but to open up it, embrace it, knock-out, to use a sports term, perhaps to dance with it.
and maybe we'll see adversity as something natural, consistent and useful, something that doesn't pull us down.
in this year, charles darwin's 200 years, and 150 years ago, when he wrote about evolution, darwin struck a truth about the human character.
to paraphrase, not the most powerful species survive and no smartest, but that can adapt to change.
conflict generates creation.
from darwin's work, among other things, we can see that human ability to survive and flourish is held by the battle of human spirit, from conflict to transformation.
once again, transformation, adapting is the biggest attribute of man.
and maybe, until we're testing, we don't know why we are capable.
maybe this gives us the adversity: a sense of self, knowledge of our own power.
so we can make ourselves a gift.
we can redefine adversity like something more than some heavy times.
we can see it as a change.
adversity is the change we haven't yet adapted to.
i think the biggest adversity i created is the idea of normality.
who is normal?
there is no normality.
there are common traits, typical, but not normal.
and would you really want to know such a banal person?
i don't think so.
if we can change this paradigm from the aspiration to normality or force, to say a little bit more, we can release the force of many children and we can support them to use their valuable skills in the community.
anthropologists tell us that the only thing we people, we asked from the community members was to be used, to contribute.
it's found that the neanderthal people, 60, 000 years ago, they were carrying the old ones and the physical deficiente, and maybe because their experience of survival turned out to be valuable for the community.
they didn't see these people as infirm or unfortunately.
they were considered bad and valuable.
a few years ago, i was in a market in my hometown, in that red area in the pennsylvania denial, and i was looking at a red box.
it was summer. i was in short pants.
" i heard the voice of a man behind me, " " there's no aimee mullins. " " and i went back and i saw a old man i didn't know. "
" i said, " " excuse me. do we know? i don't remember. " " he said to me, " " you wouldn't be able to remember me. " " "
" " " when we met, we're just helping your mother to be born. " " "
so he was.
and i remembered it.
that man was dr. kean, a man i just knew from my mom's stories, because i usually came to the world with a couple of weeks delay.
and my mom's doctor left on vacation.
so the one who helped to bring my world was a stranger for my parents.
and because i was born without the ticking, and because i had the legs that i was laughing and only a few fingers on my feet, he had to give the bad news.
" he said to me, " " i had to say to your parents, " " that you're never going to go, " " and you're never going to have the mobility that other kids have, " " or independent life. " " "
" " " but you've shown me that i was wrong. " " what's more extraordinary is that it's kept the newspaper articles in the newspaper that i came up with, since my childhood. "
when i won the orthodox contest in the second grade, when i was with the other research in halloween's halloween's parade, when i took my college or my mistakes.
he gave them the residents of residents, the medicine students from hahnemann and hershey.
and he called this x-factor, the potential of human will.
no diagnostic could sit in the path of the power of the will, as it's determined in the quality of somebody's life.
" and dr. kean told me, " " from my experience, if it doesn't tell the opposite, " " and if it's also the smallest support, " " " " if it's left to do what it wants, a child will perform. " " "
dr. kean did that change in mentality.
he understood that there's a difference between the diagnosis of the doctor and the way anyone respond to it.
and my mindset has changed over time.
if you asked me 15 years if i would give the prostheses in exchange of meat and os, i wouldn't have ezitat a second.
at that time, i would aspire to that kind of normality.
if you ask me today, i'm not so safe.
" and that' s" " thanks to the experiences that we had with them, and not in spite of them. " " "
perhaps this change in me has been produced because i was exposed to more people who opened my doors than those who closed them in front of me.
so, you see, you don't need one person to have the revelation of the power, and you're on the right way.
if you can give someone the key to its own power, the human spirit is so skeptical. . . if you can do that, and you open them a door at a very crucial moment, you educate it as we need.
you learn it to open its doors.
" in fact, the word" " educate" " has rooted" " root. " " "
it's about to put in the back of the plan that's inside, to make the potential value.
so, again, what potential do we want to get out of obvious?
there was a case of case in the u. k. , in the' 60s, when they went from classic schools to the different classes.
it's about the categories of students.
they're separated with a, b, with c, etc.
students with having a harder programmer, the best teachers, etc.
for three months, the students of d received a, they told me they were to, they were told they were smart.
after this three-month period, they had a note performance.
the revers of medalia was that the students had told me that i am a note.
and this happened after the three months.
some of them were in school. others gave up at studies.
the crucial part of this study is that teachers were broken.
they didn't know that something changed.
they were told that students had also had d.
and they treated him.
i think the onlyicap is a zdrobit spirit, which has no hopeless.
i don't see beauty anymore.
he doesn't have the natural curiosity of the child and the innate capacity to imagine.
if, instead, we can determine the spirit of a human to keep the hope, see the beauty of itself and others, be curious and full of imagination, means we use our power as we need.
when a spirit has those qualities, we can create new reality and new ways to be.
i want to leave you with a poem, written by a poet persan from the second, 14 named hafiz, who said to me, my friend jacques dembois.
" poetry is called" " god who knows only four words. " " "
" " " every child met god. " " " " no god of words, " " not god of interdictions, " " " " but a god who knows only four words and all repeats them, " " saying, come on, come up with me. " " "
" " " come and dance with me. " " thank you. "
